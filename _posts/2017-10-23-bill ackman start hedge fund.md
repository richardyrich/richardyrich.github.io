<p class="small">采访日期：2013年10月29号</p><br>
<p class="small">地点：牛津大学赛德商学院（Said Business School）</p><br>
<p class="small">项目名称：赛德商学院杰出演讲者系列（Saïd Business School Distinguished Speaker Series）</p>

<br>

采访者：我想（为比尔）做一点简单的背景介绍。我相信比尔和我是在1991年第一次见面。当时的情况是你当时是大约25岁的模样，而我在两年前刚刚成为一位大学教授。比尔在当时尝试着创立一个有意思的公司，而这公司最终发展成了Gotham Partners。**在他还是一个20多岁的时候，与在坐的各位学生们相仿的年龄，比尔成立了他第一家对冲基金。**比尔，为什么你会选择创建Gotham？而你从中又学到了什么经验？

<p class="large-block-text">Interviewer question: To set the stage here. I think Bill… it’s 1991 when you and I first met. To put this in context, you were mid-twenties and I've just gotten started as a rookie professor two years before. Bill at the time was trying to set up an interesting business which ultimately became Gotham Partners. For those of you who are students, as a 20-something-year-old, Bill set up his first hedge fund. Why did you set up Gotham, Bill? What did you learn from that experience?</p>

<br>

比尔：嗯...**经验就是犯错误并且从中学习**，这是我学到的事情。（采访者偷笑）我的回答是，我去商学院的目的是为了能够成为一名优秀的投资者。我学会的第一个投资法则就是，你在投钱之前需要做好尽职调查。当我进入哈佛商学院的时候，当我第一次我打开课程目录，我发现这里并没有投资课程，没有会计课程，也没有金融课程，所以我决定给自己设计一个小型研究生项目。

<p class="large-block-text">Bill Ackman: Emm... Experience is making mistakes and learning from them. That’s what I have learned. So the answer is, I went to business school to learn how to be a good investor. I learned the first rule of investing, which is you do your due diligence before you wire your money. When I got to HBS, I actually opened the course catalog for the first time, there wasn't a class on investing not a class on accounting, not a class on finance. So I decided I had to develop my own little self-study program.</p>

<br>

我去fidelity注册了一个证券账户，然后我把以前做房地产中介的钱放进去。我把这当做是我的投资课的学费，大概相当于一年的哈佛MBA学费。如果我全部都赔进了股市，那么我就相当于用了三年的学费上了两年研究生，你懂的。有点像是你们牛津大学1+1项目的反义词。（学生笑）结果我买的第一个股票涨了，我说：“好吧，我找到了我想做的事情了”。（学生大笑）好吧实际上我还做了更多的事情。

<p class="large-block-text"> So I wanted to... So I opened a fidelity brokerage account. I said this: “I had some money I've made in the real estate brokerage business. This was my tuition in the investment business." It was about a year of tuition. If I lost it, it was as if I had gone to business school for two years but paid for three. I figure it is being the inverse of the Oxford 1+1 program. And you know, the first stock I bought went up and I said: "Okey, I found what I want to do." A little bit more involved than that.</p>

<br>

我父亲今天也来了，他就在坐在那个角落。（指了指观众席）你可以在演讲结束时问他任何问题。（学生大笑）**他和我说刚从商学院毕业就做自己的投资基金是一个很愚蠢的想法，他建议我去给迈克尔·斯坦哈特或者乔治·索罗斯或者某个当时有名的投资者工作。**但是我觉得我懂的足够多了。这就是年轻的危险之处。但是我当时的想法是，我是一个企业家了，我想用自己的方式做投资，而不是从别人身上学习。

<p class="large-block-text">But I...actually my father—who's here, he came with us, that's dad over there in the corner—you can ask him whatever questions you want afterwards. He told me it is a really dumb idea to start an investment fund right out of the business school. And he recommended that I go work for Michael Steinhardt or George Soros or one of the other famous investors at the time. But I figured that I know enough. This is the perils of youth. But the answer is, I was an entrepreneur. And I felt that I wanted to approach investing my own way as opposed to learning from someone else.</p>

<br>

**投资是为数不多的你可以自己学习的事情。**你可以读书，读年报，投资100美金，便就是一个简单的投资组合。这样你就能学习投资了。在我看来，别的事业学起来比投资要复杂的多。

<p class="large-block-text">It's one of the few things you can really learn on your own. You can learn investing by reading books, by reading annual reports, by having a...you can have a portfolio and invest $100 and you can learn the business, unlike many other businesses, which require a lot more. At least that is what I thought at the time.</p>
