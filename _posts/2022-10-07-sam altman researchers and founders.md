我花了很多年与公司创始人一起共事，现在我与研究人员一起工作。<br>
I spent many years working with founders and now I work with researchers.

<br>

尽管总有个别例外，但平均而言，这些群体中最优秀的人有多么独特，这让我感到惊讶（包括我认为世界各地的优秀人士都有的一些品质，比如非常强的自信心）。

Although there are always individual exceptions, on average it’s surprising to me how different the best people in these groups are (including in some qualities that I had assumed were present in great people everywhere, like very high levels of self-belief).

<br>

所以我一直在思考他们的相同之处，因为也许总体上真正高效的人的品质是有一些值得我们学习的一些东西。

So I’ve been thinking about the ways they’re the same, because maybe there is something to learn about qualities of really effective people in general.

<br>

这两组人群中最优秀的人都会花费大量时间来思考某些令人注意的问题——“你所在领域最重要的问题是什么，你为什么不去解决它们？” 总的来说，没有人对这个问题有足够的反思，但最优秀的人做的最多，并且有最好的“问题品味”。“问题品味”是学习独立思考、推理未来和识别解决问题突破口的组合。（ John Schulman 的这篇文章值得一读：http://joschu.net/blog/opinionated-guide-ml-research.html）。

The best people in both groups spend a lot of time reflecting on some version of the Hamming question—"what are the most important problems in your field, and why aren’t you working on them?” In general, no one reflects on this question enough, but the best people do it the most, and have the best ‘problem taste’, which is some combination of learning to think independently, reason about the future, and identify attack vectors. (This from John Schulman is worth reading: http://joschu.net/blog/opinionated-guide-ml-research.html).

<br>

他们将焦点放在他们面前的下一步上，并与他们的长期愿景相结合。 大多数人只能做到前者或者后者。

They have a laser focus on the next step in front of them combined with long-term vision. Most people only have one or the other.

<br>

他们非常执着，愿意努力工作。 据我所知，没有这一个特点就没有很大的成功机会，你应该怀疑那些告诉你不需要那么的人，除非你很高兴也成为他们（你尤其要怀疑他们其实在悄悄努力）。

They are extremely persistent and willing to work hard. As far as I can tell, there is no high-probability way to be very successful without this, and you should be suspicious of people who tell you otherwise unless you’d be happy having their career (and be especially suspicious if they worked hard themselves).

<br>

他们倾向于实际行动和尝试新事物，他们对什么是有效的，什么是无效的判断很冷静而且诚实（重要的是，这是双向的——我很惊讶地见过有不少人会找到了一些有效的东西，然后选择不去追随它们）。

They have a bias towards action and trying things, and they’re clear-eyed and honest about what is working and what isn’t (importantly, this goes both ways—I’m amazed by how many people will see something working and then not pursue it).

<br>

他们是创意的产生者——很多想法可能很糟糕，但从不缺少想法。

They are creative idea-generators—a lot of the ideas may be terrible, but there is never a shortage.

<br>

他们真的很重视自主权，并且很难遵守他们认为没有意义的规则。 它们绝对不是盲目从众的旅鼠。

They really value autonomy and have a hard time with rules that they don’t think make sense. They are definitely not lemmings.

<br>

他们的动机往往比看起来更复杂——特别是，他们经常受到真正意义的好奇心驱使。

Their motivations are often more complex than they seem—specifically, they are frequently very driven by genuine curiosity.
