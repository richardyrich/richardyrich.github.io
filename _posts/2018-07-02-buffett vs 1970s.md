### 1\. 从股票指数的表现而言，美国的20世纪70年代可能投资者的噩梦

* 道琼斯工业指数（Dow Jones Industrial Average）从1964年12月31日的874.12点到1981年12月31日的875.00，换句话说，道琼斯在17年内只涨了0.88点 [1]
* 如果说沪深300从07年以后从未回到历史最高点这件事已经能让散户苦不堪言，那么可以想象如果散户们发现一个股市在17年的周期里终于回到原点是怎么样的滋味
* 与此同时对应的是债市的超高额的收益率，即使是理智告诉你股市在长期来看（比如10到20年的周期）是非常大概率超过债券，但是在股市如此漫长的周期里面的低迷表现以及国债就能达到的9.5%甚至以上的收益率，很难让一个投资者相信，此时长期持有股票依然是正确决定（下图是1960年1月1号到2018年5月1号，10年期政府债券的收益率）

* 在这样的大环境下，本杰明格雷厄姆（Benjamin Graham）在聪明的投资者（The Intelligent Investor）中推荐的保守投资策略50%债券50%股票似乎也变的合理很多[3]；这样的配比在当前美国超低利率环境下可能实用性会低很多

> We are thus led to put forward for most of our readers what may appear to be an oversimplified 50– 50 formula. Under this plan the guiding rule is to maintain as nearly as practicable an equal division between bond and stock holdings. When changes in the market level have raised the common-stock component to, say, 55%, the balance would be restored by a sale of one-eleventh of the stock portfolio and the transfer of the proceeds to bonds. Conversely, a fall in the common-stock proportion to 45% would call for the use of one-eleventh of the bond fund to buy additional equities.

* 不过即使如此，因为股票会派发股息，所以也不是说这17年一无所获

### 2\. 巴菲特与牛市

* 提到巴菲特，很多人都会不自觉的想起巴菲特投资的时期恰好和美国历史上最长第一次牛市相吻合（如果忽略1990-1991年期间那段相对轻微的熊市，这段超长牛市大概从1987持续到2000），下面这句话来自1999巴菲特被刊登在财富杂志（Fortune Magazine）上面的原句[5]：

> The power of interest rates had the effect of pushing up equities as well, though other things that we will get to pushed additionally. And so here's what equities did in that same 17 years: If you'd invested $1 million in the Dow on Nov. 16, 1981, and reinvested all dividends, you'd have had $19,720,112 on Dec. 31, 1998. And your annual return would have been 19%.
The increase in equity values since 1981 beats anything you can find in history. This increase even surpasses what you would have realized if you'd bought stocks in 1932, at their Depression bottom--on its lowest day, July 8, 1932, the Dow closed at 41.22--and held them for 17 years.

* 但是有意思的是这段时期并不是巴菲特表现最好的年份：巴菲特投资最好的时期是早前的巴菲特合伙人（Buffett Partnership），从1957-1969，投资收益29.5% [7]
* 其次是伯克希尔哈撒韦在60年代的表现（见下图）

* 如果将巴菲特个人账户的业绩也考虑进来的话，最好的时期之一大概是他从哥伦比亚大学经济学硕士毕业到1955年期间（1951-1955），大约的年化收益在89%以上（具体日期不可考）[9]

> The thing is, when I got out of college, I had $9,800, but by the end of 1955, I was up to $127,000. I thought, I’ll go back to Omaha, take some college classes, and read a lot—I was going to retire! I figured we could live on $12,000 a year, and off my $127,000 asset base, I could easily make that. I told my wife, “Compound interest guarantees I’m going to get rich.”

* 从巴菲特历史的业绩可以看出，70年代，滞胀时期（stagflation），也是巴菲特相对表现没那么好的时间段；至于90年代的下滑是由于伯克希尔哈撒韦的资产太大管理困难，不能够完全反映巴菲特的完全的投资能力
周期天王周金涛在涛动周期论提到了这么一件事，他说巴菲特的成功得益于时机 [10] 他说的很有道理，这也是巴菲特自己本人承认的事情："I won the ovarian lottery" [11]

> 巴菲特没什么，为什么能够投资成功，原因就在于他出生在第五次康波周期的回升阶段。如果是出生在现在一样不会成功，这个就是由你的宿命决定的。

* 不过研究巴菲特的投资哲学和选股思路依然有价值，原因有三个：1. 巴菲特在刚毕业决定投资的时期，对他人生影响最大的两个人都明确告诉他当前的形势不值得投资。巴菲特的父亲霍华德巴菲特和老师格雷汉姆都不建议他进行投资，而考虑到他的父亲和格雷汉姆在他心中的分量，做出如此决定，也意味着他自己本身有一套自己坚信的投资策略 （当然啦，至少不是一个错误的策略），这样的投资策略也可能是他能在人生未来3/4个世纪不轻易被他人言语左右的原因之一[12]；2. 巴菲特的业绩无法直接用周期来解释，最好的年份不一定是牛市期，最差的也不一定是熊市期；3. 就算是说在美国投资出生对了时间是最大成功要素，成为巴菲特这样成功的投资者依然有限得多

> As a matter of course, however, he consulted his father and Ben Graham. To his surprise, both said, “Maybe you should wait a few years.” Graham—as always—thought the market was too high. Howard, pessimistic, favored mining stocks and gold stocks and other investments designed to protect against inflation. He didn’t think any other kind of business would be a good investment, and he worried about his son’s future.
...
“It was absolutely the reverse effect of what you saw in other times, when the market was staggeringly overvalued. I had looked at companies. I just couldn’t see why you wouldn’t want to own them. It was on a micro level, not an assessment of the growth of the economy or anything like that, and I was working with micro money. But it just seemed to me that it was crazy not to own them. On the other hand, here’s Ben, with his two hundred IQ, telling me to wait. And my dad, who, if he told me to walk out a window, I would have done it.” To make this decision to defy the advice of his two great authorities—his father and Ben Graham—was an enormous step for Warren. It required him to consider the possibility that his judgment might be superior to theirs. Yet he was certain he was right. He might have walked out a window if his father told him to—but not if it meant leaving a Moody’s Manual full of cheap stocks behind.

### 3\. 巴菲特与熊市

* 相比之下，巴菲特在熊市期，或者是熊市末期的态度也是非常有趣，以下三篇文章大家有兴趣可以搜索

* 也许也应验了他本人经常被引用的那句话：在别人恐惧时贪婪，在别人贪婪时恐惧（Fearful when others are greedy and greedy when others are fearful.）
