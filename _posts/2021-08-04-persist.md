Why should you still be positive toward life when it seems hard to continue？

* Although failure is humiliating, but few people will remember
* Life is yours. Your life is the free car you get when you get born. It is free but it is the only car in your life you will ever get to use. 
* Hardworking is exciting and can be exhilarating 
* Working with smart and energetic people is interesting
* Even failure is exciting
* Life is very sort. Up and low is part of the process
