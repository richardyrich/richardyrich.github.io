很多人想在其他行业或其他地方或以其他策略复制 YC。 总的来说，人们似乎认为：1）尽管YC的发展的存在某种程度的神秘或运气，但它不会那么难，2）如果你能把它弄好，网络效应是自我持续的。

A lot of people want to replicate YC in some other industry or some other place or with some other strategy. In general, people seem to assume that: 1) although there was some degree of mystery or luck about how YC got going, it can’t be that hard, and 2) if you can get it off the ground, the network effects are self-sustaining.

<br>

更多类似YC的东西对世界有好处； 我通常会尽力提供帮助。 但几乎没有一个是成功的。人们对自我持续部分的看法是正确的，但他们没有搞明白怎么起步这一件事情。

More YC-like things are good for the world; I generally try to be helpful. But almost none of them work. People are right about the self-sustaining part, but they can’t figure out how to get something going.

<br>

YC 开始的全部秘诀就是保罗·格雷厄姆（Paul Graham）和杰西卡·利文斯顿（Jessica Livingston）——没有其他魔法。这是一年我会做几次的事情：我在一个聚会上进行了一次谈话，有人讲述了保罗·格雷厄姆改变了他们的生活的故事——人们说话时的感激之情比他们对几乎任何其他人所做的都要多。然后其他人都同意，YC创始人和其他人（非创始人可能会谈论一篇有影响力的文章或被YC创业者的公司聘用）。遗憾的是，杰西卡仍然没有获得几乎相同程度的点名表扬，但YC早期的人都知道杰西卡对YC的贡献。

The entire secret to YC getting going was PG and Jessica—there was no other magic trick. A few times a year, I end up in a conversation at a party where someone tells a story about how much PG changed their life—people speak with more gratitude than they do towards pretty much anyone else. Then everyone else agrees, YC founders and otherwise (non-YC founders might talk about an impactful essay or getting hired at a YC company). Jessica still sadly doesn’t get nearly the same degree of public credit, but the people who were around the early days of YC know the real story.

<br>

他们做了什么？ 他们对无名小卒充分信任，并且比以往任何人都更加相信他们。 他们制定了严格的规范，并坚决反对针对 YC 创始人的不良行为。 他们相信自己的信念，愿意按照自己的方式做事，并且愿意被现有的权力结构所厌恶。 他们专注于最重要的事情，他们努力工作，他们花了很多时间与人进行一对一的交流。 他们了解社区和长期定位的价值。 在 YC 还是很小的时候，团队感觉就像一个大家庭。

What did they do? They took bets on unknown people and believed in them more than anyone had before. They set strong norms and fought back hard against bad behavior towards YC founders. They trusted their own convictions, were willing to do things their way, and were willing to be disliked by the existing power structures. They focused on the most important things, they worked hard, and they spent a huge amount of time 1:1 with people. They understood the value of community and long-term orientation. When YC was very small, it felt like a family.

<br>

也许最重要的是，他们建立了一个生态系统（感谢 Joe Gebbia 指出这一点）。 这说起来容易做起来难，因为这样做需要不贪婪。 YC 故意放掉了很多赚钱的机会； 其他人从生态系统中赚到的钱比 YC 自己赚的还多。 这巩固了 YC 的地位——合作伙伴、校友、当前季度的创业营创始人、Hacker News 读者、Demo Day 投资者以及 YC 周围的其他所有人的利益是其运作的重要组成部分。

Perhaps most importantly, they built an ecosystem (thanks to Joe Gebbia for pointing this out). This is easy to talk about but hard to do, because it requires not being greedy. YC has left a lot of money on the table; other people have made more money from the ecosystem than YC has itself. This has cemented YC’s place—the benefits to the partners, alumni, current batch founders, Hacker News readers, Demo Day investors, and everyone else around YC is a huge part of what makes it work.

<br>

我不确定其中是否有任何特别有用的建议——听起来都不难，但从那以后的 15 年里，它还没有接近被复制。

I am not sure if any of this is particularly useful advice—none of it sounds that hard, and yet in the 15 years since, it hasn’t been close to replicated.

<br>

但似乎值得一试。 我敢肯定，在那段时间里，没有人对初创领域的人们的职业生涯产生比他们两人更大的总体影响。

But it seems worth trying. I am pretty sure no one has had a bigger total impact on the careers of people in the startup industry over that time period than the two of them.
