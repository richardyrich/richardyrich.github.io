<br>

格雷汉姆和多德的“寻找能提供安全边际的低价投资”方法是否已经过气了？撰写当下学生课本的那些砖家说反正他们信了。他们的理由是股市是有效的；也就是说，股价反映了公司发展潜力和当前情况的所有公开信息。这一理论的支持者们认为被低估的股票是不存在的，因为聪明的证券分析师们运用了所有公开信息一致达成了一个合理无误的价格。那些能够一年又一年击败市场平均的人仅仅是运气好。如今的一本教材的作者是这么说的“如果价格完全反映了所有公开信息，那么选股能力是假的是特技”。

Is the Graham and Dodd “look for values with a significant margin of safety relative to prices” approach to security analysis out of date? Many of the professors who write textbooks today say yes. They argue that the stock market is efficient; that is, that stock prices reflect everything that is known about a company’s prospects and about the state of the economy. There are no undervalued stocks, these theorists argue, because there are smart security analysts who utilize all available information to ensure unfailingly appropriate prices. Investors who seem to beat the market year after year are just lucky. “If prices fully reflect available information, this sort of investment adeptness is ruled out,” writes one of today’s textbook authors.

<br>

好吧，或许如此。但是我想做的事，给大家展示一群投资者们，年复一年，达到超越标准普尔500指数的收益。那么让我们看看他们是不是确实只是运气好。在分析之前需要指出的一个重要信息是，他们都是我的老铁，而且最晚也在15年前就别人被认为是优秀的投资大咖。如果抛开这一点，如果我只是在今天早上从上千个样本中临时找出这么几个人，那么我建议你们别听我忽悠。另外值得指出的一点是这些信息已经被审计过。再加上一点是，我也认识很多他们的客户，他们拿到手上的收益也能证明这些投资记录是真实的。

Well, maybe. But I want to present to you a group of investors who have, year in and year out, beaten the Standard & Poor’s 500 stock index. The hypothesis that they do this by pure chance is at least worth examining. Crucial to this examination is the fact that these winners were all well known to me and pre-identified as superior investors, the most recent identification occurring over fifteen years ago. Absent this condition - that is, if I had just recently searched among thousands of records to select a few names for you this morning — I would advise you to stop reading right here. I should add that all of these records have been audited. And I should further add that I have known many of those who have invested with these managers, and the checks received by those participants over the years have matched the stated records.

<br>

在我们正式开始之前，我想让大家脑洞这么一个全国性的抛硬币大赛。假设我们让2.25亿美国人在明天早上起来的时候往奖池里投入各投入1美元。在太阳升起时，他们出门，并投掷一次硬币。如果他们猜对了结果，那么他们可以从猜错的那群人手中拿走1美元。每一天，猜错的人将会被淘汰，奖金被返还奖池，因此奖金也逐渐翻倍。10天以后，大概220,000位美国人将会保持连胜记录。他们各自的奖金已经累计至1,000美元以上。

Before we begin this examination, I would like you to imagine a national coin-flipping contest. Let’s assume we get 225 million Americans up tomorrow morning and we ask them all to wager a dollar. They go out in the morning at sunrise, and they all call the flip of a coin. If they call correctly, they win a dollar from those who called wrong. Each day the losers drop out, and on the subsequent day the stakes build as all previous winnings are put on the line. After ten flips on ten mornings, there will be approximately 220,000 people in the United States who have correctly called ten flips in a row. They each will have won a little over $1,000.

<br>

现在这群人将会开始有点小膨胀，这是人性使然。他们可能会尽可能不装逼，但是在鸡尾酒派对里他们将会不时向心仪的异性悄悄秀一秀他们的投掷技巧，以及他们在抛硬币领域的新发现是多么的牛逼。

Now this group will probably start getting a little puffed up about this, human nature being what it is. They may try to be modest, but at cocktail parties they will occasionally admit to attractive members of the opposite sex what their technique is, and what marvelous insights they bring to the field of flipping.

<br>

假设所有的赢家都能从败者获得奖金，再过10天，我们会发现有215人做到了20连胜并且已经将当初的1美元变成了1百万美元以上。这场游戏所有参与者的共计奖金是2.25亿美金，共计亏损也是2.25亿。

Assuming that the winners are getting the appropriate rewards from the losers, in another ten days we will have 215 people who have successfully called their coin flips 20 times in a row and who, by this exercise, each have turned one dollar into a little over $1 million. $225 million would have been lost, $225 million would have been won.

<br>

在此时，这些赢家已经控几不住我记几。他们可能会上知乎答题“每天工作30秒在20天内将1美元变成1百万是怎样一番体验”。更糟糕的是，他们可能会开始乘坐飞机全国各地参加学术会议讨论如何高效抛硬币并反驳那些质疑的大学教授“这是特技是假的，为什么全国会有215个这样的赢家？”

By then, this group will really lose their heads. They will probably write books on “How I turned a Dollar into a Million in Twenty Days Working Thirty Seconds a Morning.” Worse yet, they’ll probably start jetting around the country attending seminars on efficient coin-flipping and tackling skeptical professors with, “If it can’t be done, why are there 215 of us?”

<br>

在这个时候一些商学院的教授可能会果敢地站出来diss，如果让2.25亿个猩猩从事同样的事情，事情的结果基本也是类似，将有215只自傲的猩猩能做到20连胜。

By then some business school professor will probably be rude enough to bring up the fact that if 225 million orangutans had engaged in a similar exercise, the results would be much the same — 215 egotistical orangutans with 20 straight winning flips.

<br>

但是，我要指出的是，我接下来的例子将与这个假设情况不同。其中一点是，如果(a)这2.25亿只猩猩像美国人口一样分散；(b)20天后有215位赢家；以及(c)如果其中的30只来自于奥马哈的一个动物园，那么你会感觉到这次情况会有些不同。你可能会出门去问问动物园管理员给他们吃什么长大的，是否进行了某种特别的培训技巧，让它们读过什么书，还有一系列有的没的。也就是说，如果你发现任何集中出现的成功个案，你可能会想看看是否有某些特别的因素导致了这一情况。

I would argue, however, that there are some important differences in the examples I am going to present. For one thing, if (a) you had taken 225 million orangutans distributed roughly as the U.S. population is; if (b) 215 winners were left after 20 days; and if (c) you found that 40 came from a particular zoo in Omaha, you would be pretty sure you were on to something. So you would probably go out and ask the zookeeper about what he’s feeding them, whether they had special exercises, what books they read, and who knows what else. That is, if you found any really extraordinary concentrations of success, you might want to see if you could identify concentrations of unusual characteristics that might be causal factors.

<br>

科研自然而然地寻找这样的规律。如果你想找到某种特殊的癌症的诱因，某一种一年会在美国有1,500个案例的那种，然后你发现其中400例出现在一个在蒙大拿州的一个小矿镇，你会对当地的水质产生怀疑，或者是那些病人的职业类型，或者是其他变量。你知道400例集中出现在一个小区域的情况不会是随机事件
。你可能不一定会知道具体因素，但是你知道去哪里寻找线索。

Scientific inquiry naturally follows such a pattern. If you were trying to analyze possible causes of a rare type of cancer — with, say, 1,500 cases a year in the United States — and you found that 400 of them occurred in some little mining town in Montana, you would get very interested in the water there, or the occupation of those afflicted, or other variables. You know it’s not random chance that 400 come from a small area. You would not necessarily know the causal factors, but you would know where to search.

<br>

我承认寻找诱因的方法除了地域还有别的。除了地理位置上的原因，还有我称为是信息的原因。我认为你会从一个叫做格雷汉姆-多德市的小镇里面找到相当一部分成功的投资界连胜者。这样集中呈现的连胜者无法用简单的概率来解释。

I submit to you that there are ways of defining an origin other than geography. In addition to geographical origins, there can be what I call an intellectual origin. I think you will find that a disproportionate number of successful coin-flippers in the investment world came from a very small intellectual village that could be called Graham-and-Doddsville. A concentration of winners that simply cannot be explained by chance can be traced to this particular intellectual village.

<br>

某些情况下，这种集中出现的情况可能并不能意味什么。可能这100个人只是因为听从某个有说服力的人的洗脑。当他认为下一次出现的是正面，100个粉丝也跟着说下一个是正面。如果这个领导者恰好是那剩下的215个人之一，那么这100个追随者的成功案例并不代表什么出色的猜硬币能力。你只是将一个特例理解为100个特例而已。相似地，如果美国是一个全都听爸爸的社会，而每一个家庭恰好不多不少10个成员。假如这个父系社会的文化是如此保守，以至于从始至终，家庭里面的每个成员都听从着家长的指引。这么一来，20天以后，你找到的这215位赢家实际上是来自21.5个家庭。一些没有经验的统计学家可能会说听爸爸的话是预测硬币结果的重大影响因素。但是，这并不意味着是215位独立的优胜者，只是21.5个随机分布的赢者家庭而已。

Conditions could exist that would make even that concentration unimportant. Perhaps 100 people were simply imitating the coin-flipping call of some terribly persuasive personality. When he called heads, 100 followers automatically called that coin the same way. If the leader was part of the 215 left at the end, the fact that 100 came from the same intellectual origin would mean nothing. You would simply be identifying one case as a hundred cases. Similarly, let’s assume that you lived in a strongly patriarchal society and every family in the United States conveniently consisted of ten members. Further assume that the patriarchal culture was so strong that, when the 225 million people went out the first day, every member of the family identified with the father’s call. Now, at the end of the 20-day period, you would have 215 winners, and you would find that they came from only 21.5 families. Some naive types might say that this indicates an enormous hereditary factor as an explanation of successful coin-flipping. But, of course, it would have no significance at all because it would simply mean that you didn’t have 215 individual winners, but rather 21.5 randomly distributed families who were winners.

<br>

在这组我将要介绍的成功的投资者里面，有一个共同的领导者，本格雷汉姆。但是这个家庭里面出来的孩子们有他们各自的独特的猜币技巧。他们去了不同的地方，买了各自不同的公司和股票，而他们投资结果无法用简单的概率来解释。我们不能说他们是因为听从了格雷汉姆爸爸的指挥而达到了相同的结果。领导者只是教会了他们投币的理论方法，而他们各自有各自的打开方式。

In this group of successful investors that I want to consider, there has been a common intellectual patriarch, Ben Graham. But the children who left the house of this intellectual patriarch have called their "flips" in very different ways. They have gone to different places and bought and sold different stocks and companies, yet they have had a combined record that simply cannot be explained by randon chance. It certainly cannot be explained by the fact that they are all calling flips identically because a leader is signaling the calls for them to make. The patriarch has merely set forth the intellectual theory for making coin-calling decisions, but each student has decided on his own manner of applying the theory.

<br>

来自格雷汉姆-多德市的投资者们有一个共同的主题：他们寻找公司价格和其股票的市场价值的差异。基本上说，他们寻找着这一类机会，而不考虑那些有效市场假说支持者们担心的那些应该在周一还是周四买，或者应该在一月或者七月买等等的时机问题。相似地，当企业家决定买下某个公司，就像是我们这些格雷汉姆多德流派的投资者们选股那样，没有多少人会真的考虑过应该是星期几或者是哪个月去进行。我对学术界投入大量时间去考虑买入时机的行为感到吃鲸。讲道理，我们这些格雷汉姆多德投资流派的人们从不考虑什么beta，资本资产定价模型，或者是证券收益的协方差。他们都对这些不感兴趣。实际上，他们很多人都不知道这些是什么鬼。这些投资者只关注两个变量：价格和价值。

The common intellectual theme of the investors from Graham-and-Doddsville is this: they search for discrepancies between the value of a business and the price of small pieces of that business in the market. Essentially, they exploit those discrepancies without the efficient market theorist’s concern as to whether the stocks are bought on Monday or Thursday, or whether it is January or July, etc. Incidentally, when businessmen buy businesses, which is just what our Graham & Dodd investors are doing through the medium of marketable stocks — I doubt that many are cranking into their purchase decision the day of the week or the month in which the transaction is going to occur. If it doesn’t make any difference whether all of a business is being bought on a Monday or a Friday, I am baffled why academicians invest extensive time and effort to see whether it makes a difference when buying small pieces of those same businesses. Our Graham & Dodd investors, needless to say, do not discuss beta, the capital asset pricing model, or covariance in returns among securities. These are not subjects of any interest to them. In fact, most of them would have difficulty defining those terms. The investors simply focus on two variables: price and value.

<br>

我经常觉得这么多的技术分析类的关于价格和成交量行为的研究非常不可思议。你能想象吗？买入一个公司的原因只是因为这个股票过去两周是爆款。当然了，他们这么做的原因是，在信息时代，有大量的数据能够供他们使用。这并不是因为这么做有什么卯月，只是因为数据管不管都在那里不增不减，而这些学者感觉总想做点什么。尽管可能做了还不如不做。我的一个朋友说，有些人觉得如果能动手尽量别吵吵。

I always find it extraordinary that so many studies are made of price and volume behavior, the stuff of chartists. Can you imagine buying an entire business simply because the price of the business had been marked up substantially last week and the week before? Of course, the reason a lot of studies are made of these price and volume variables is that now, in the age of computers, there are almost endless data available about them. It isn’t necessarily because such studies have any utility; it’s simply that the data are there and academicians have worked hard to learn the mathematical skills needed to manipulate them. Once these skills are acquired, it seems sinful not to use them, even if the usage has no utility or negative utility. As a friend said, to a man with a hammer, everything looks like a nail.

<br>

我认为这么一个投资家族值得我们分析一下。碰巧的是，尽管这么多的学术研究都是关于价格，成交量，季节性，市值等等关于股票的表现，大家似乎对于价值投资者的出色表现没有什么兴趣。

I think the group that we have identified by a common intellectual home is worthy of study. Incidentally, despite all the academic studies of the influence of such variables as price, volume, seasonality, capitalization size, etc., upon stock performance, no interest has been evidenced in studying the methods of this unusual concentration of value-oriented winners.

<br>

我研究的第一步是扒一扒以前我们四个1954年到1956年在格雷汉姆-纽曼公司工作的四个哥们的投资记录。一共就咱们四个，我不是从几千个人里面特地找的。我当时在我上完本格雷汉姆的课后，说愿意免费给格雷汉姆-纽曼公司打工。但是他拒绝了说我工资要求太高了。他对价值投资这件事看的很认真！我不停地软磨硬泡之后他最后还是让我去上班了。当时有三个合伙人，我们四个只是打工仔。从1955年到1957年之间，在公司准备结业的时候，我们四个最后都离开了，而我找到了他们三个的投资记录。

I begin this study of results by going back to a group of four of us who worked at Graham-Newman Corporation from 1954 through 1956. There were only four — I have not selected these names from among thousands. I offered to go to work at Graham-Newman for nothing after I took Ben Graham’s class, but he turned me down as overvalued. He took this value stuff very seriously! After much pestering he finally hired me. There were three partners and four of us at the "peasant" level. All four left between 1955 and 1957 when the firm was wound up, and it’s possible to trace the record of three.

<br>

第一个例子（见表1）是华特施络斯。施络斯没读过大学，但是上过本格雷汉姆在纽约金融学院的晚课。华特在1955年离开格雷汉姆-纽曼然后在后来的28年达到表中的业绩。这是亚当斯密在1972年的那本《如何挣大钱》这么描述他的：

The first example (see Table 1) is that of Walter Schloss. Walter never went to college, but took a course from Ben Graham at night at the New York Institute of Finance. Walter left Graham-Newman in 1955 and achieved the record shown here over 28 years. Here is what ‘Adam Smith’ — after I told him about Walter — wrote about him in Supermoney (1972):

<br>

他不靠关系也不靠消息。基本上华尔街没人认识他，所以别人也不会影响他。他从手册中获得数据然后读一读年报，没别的。

He has no connections or access to useful information. Practically no one in Wall Street knows him and he is not fed any ideas. He looks up the numbers in the manuals and sends for the annual reports, and that’s about it.

<br>

沃伦在介绍施洛斯给我认识的时候，和我说到：“他从来没有忘记他是在为别人管理资产，而这更加让他不愿意接受损失”。他非常正直和自觉。资金安全以及选股对他来说是很重要的事，这是他对于“安全边际”的理解。

In introducing me to (Schloss) Warren had also, to my mind, described himself. ‘He never forgets that he is handling other people’s money, and this reinforces his normal strong aversion to loss.’ He has total integrity and a realistic picture of himself. Money is real to him and stocks are real — and from this flows an attraction to the ‘margin of safety’ principle.

<br>

华特的投资高度分散化，总是同时持有100只股票以上。他知道怎么找到那些价格远低于真实价格的股票。他净干这种事情。他不管这个月是不是一月份，他不管今天是不是星期一，他不管今年会不会有总统大选。他总是说，如果一个公司的价值有1美元，而我能够用40美分买，那么我可能运气不会太差。他的持股数量比我多了不少，而且并不怎么关心公司本身的基本面；我似乎没办法影响华特的决定。这是他的特长；没人能影响他的思考。

Walter has diversified enormously, owning well over 100 stocks currently. He knows how to identify securities that sell at considerably less than their value to a private owner. And that’s all he does. He doesn’t worry about whether it it’s January, he doesn’t worry about whether it’s Monday, he doesn’t worry about whether it’s an election year. He simply says, if a business is worth a dollar and I can buy it for 40 cents, something good may happen to me. And he does it over and over and over again. He owns many more stocks than I do — and is far less interested in the underlying nature of the business; I don’t seem to have very much influence on Walter. That’s one of his strengths; no one has much influence on him.

<br>

第二例子是汤姆那普，也是和我在格雷汉姆-纽曼共事的哥们。汤姆在参军前在普林斯顿学的是化学；当他退役以后，常常去海边晒太阳。结果有一天他听到大卫多德在哥伦比亚大学的晚课里面教投资。汤姆决定以不记学分的形式上了他的课。巧在我35年后再一次找到他提供一些今天的演讲的资料时，我又发现他去海边晒太阳了。只是这一次海滩是被他承包了！

The second case is Tom Knapp who also worked at Graham-Newman with me. Tom was a chemistry major at Princeton before the war; when he came back from the war, he was a beach bum. And then one day he read that Dave Dodd was giving a night course in investments at Columbia. Tom took it on a noncredit basis, and he got so interested in the subject from taking that course that he came up and enrolled at Columbia Business School, where he got the MBA degree. He took Dodd’s course again, and took Ben Graham’s course. Incidentally, 35 years later I called Tom to ascertain some of the facts involved here and I found him on the beach again. The only difference is that now he owns the beach!

<br>

1968年，汤姆那普和艾德安德森，另一个格雷汉姆的学生，以及另外一两个学生，成立了崔迪布朗合伙人，然后他们的投资业绩展示在表2。崔迪布朗同样也是分散投资。他们有时候会选择控股，但是参股投资和控股投资的收益是一样的。

In 1968, Tom Knapp and Ed Anderson, also a Graham disciple, along with one or two other fellows of similar persuasion, formed Tweedy, Browne Partners, and their investment results appear in Table 2. Tweedy, Browne built that record with very wide diversification. They occasionally bought control of businesses, but the record of the passive investments is equal to the record of the control investments.

<br>

表3来自我的这个小组里面的第三个人，在1957年组成巴菲特合伙人。他做的最正确的事情是在1969年离开了这个公司。然后从此，伯克希尔哈撒韦在某种程度上是这个合伙人公司的延续。我找不到一个指数能够合理地展示伯克希尔的投资管理情况。但是从哪种方式来理解，你都可以认为这是令人满意的。

Table 3 describes the third member of the group who formed Buffett Partnership in 1957. The best thing he did was to quit in 1969. Since then, in a sense, Berkshire Hathaway has been a continuation of the partnership in some respects. There is no single index I can give you that I would feel would be a fair test of investment management at Berkshire. But I think that any way you figure it, it has been satisfactory.

<br>

表4来自红杉基金，这是一个我在1951年在本格雷汉姆同班的同学，比尔鲁恩。当他从哈佛商学院毕业以后，他去华尔街上班了。然后他发现他需要一点靠谱的商学院教育，于是他去上了本在哥伦比亚的课，也就是我们第一次认识的1951年。比尔的投资记录从1951年持续到1970，本金不大，最后的结果远超过市场平均值。当我关闭巴菲特合伙人的时候我问比尔是否愿意开设一个基金帮我们的合伙人管理资产，他设立了红杉基金。注册的时间，并不是一个好时刻，也正是我觉得不适合投资而选择退出的时刻。他立刻就开始了二级市场的投资，哪怕那时候很难找到能用来参照价值投资业绩的基准。我惊奇地发现，我当时的那些合伙人，不仅仅只是转移了资产，还追加了一部分新的资金。最后的结果展示在此。

Table 4 shows the record of the Sequoia Fund, which is managed by a man whom I met in 1951 in Ben Graham’s class, Bill Ruane. After getting out of Harvard Business School, he went to Wall Street. Then he realized that he needed to get a real business education so he came up to take Ben’s course at Columbia, where we met in early 1951. Bill’s record from 1951 to 1970, working with relatively small sums, was far better than average. When I wound up Buffett Partnership I asked Bill if he would set up a fund to handle all of our partners, so he set up the Sequoia Fund. He set it up at a terrible time, just when I was quitting. He went right into the two-tier market and all the difficulties that made for comparative performance for value-oriented investors. I am happy to say that my partners, to an amazing degree, not only stayed with him but added money, with the happy result shown here.

![](https://i.imgur.com/mh4jJTv.png)

<br>

并没有什么事后诸葛亮。比尔是我唯一推荐的投资人，我当时的说法是，如果他能年化超过标准普尔4%，就是很好的投资结果了。比尔的收益远超过这个标准，尽管后来的基金净值越来越大，而这也逐渐增大了管理的难度。管理规模会拖收益率的后腿。妥妥的如此。并不是说你没办法在管理大型基金时达到超额收益，只是这样的效果会缩小。试想一下，如果你一旦达到了2万亿美金的规模，而这个数值相当于全美国的经济总价值，你根本没办法超出平均值！

There’s no hindsight involved here. Bill was the only person I recommended to my partners, and I said at the time that if he achieved a four point per annum advantage over the Standard & Poor’s, that would be solid performance. Bill has achieved well over that, working with progressively larger sums of money. That makes things much more difficult. Size is the anchor of performance. There is no question about it. It doesn’t mean you can’t do better than average when you get larger, but the margin shrinks. And if you ever get so you’re managing two trillion dollars, and that happens to be the amount of the total equity valuation in the economy, don’t think that you’ll do better than average!

<br>

我应该补充的是，在这里展示的记录中，基本上从始至终他们都各不相同。他们都用着相同的原则，基于价值和价格的差异，但是他们做出的选择是大相径庭的。华特的最大持股部分是大蓝筹，比如哈德逊纸浆，杰都高地煤炭，纽约暗色岩以及其他那些即使只是偶尔读读商业新闻的吃瓜群众都会秒懂的公司。崔迪布朗的选择则更加地小众和非主流。另一方面，比尔选择的是大公司。这投资组合的重合部分灰常灰常低。这些投资记录并不是那种一个人决定硬币的正反然后剩下的五十个人赶紧也接着学。

I should add that, in the records we’ve looked at so far, throughout this whole period there was practically no duplication in these portfolios. These are men who select securities based on discrepancies between price and value, but they make their selections very differently. Walter’s largest holdings have been such stalwarts as Hudson Pulp & Paper and Jeddo Highland Coal and New York Trap Rock Company and all those other names that come instantly to mind to even a casual reader of the business pages. Tweedy Browne’s selections have sunk even well below that level in terms of name recognition. On the other hand, Bill has worked with big companies. The overlap among these portfolios has been very, very low. These records do not reflect one guy calling the flip and fifty people yelling out the same thing after him.

<br>

表5来自于我在哈佛法学院毕业的一个朋友，他有一家大型法律公司。我在1960年的时候认识他，然后告诉他从事法律开心就好但是他值得更好的生活。他的投资合伙人和华特的很不一样。他的投资组合非常集中，因此他的收益波动很大，但是也依然是折价买入的原则。他愿意承受更大的短期业绩波动，而他也是那一类喜欢集中投资的人。很巧，这个投资记录来自查理芒格，我长期以来伯克希尔哈撒韦经营管理的合伙人。不过当他经营他的合伙人公司的时候，他的投资组合和我的以及前面提到的几个老铁的差别很大。

Table 5 is the record of a friend of mine who is a Harvard Law graduate, who set up a major law firm. I ran into him in about 1960 and told him that law was fine as a hobby but he could do better. He set up a partnership quite the opposite of Walter’s. His portfolio was concentrated in very few securities and therefore, his record was much more volatile but it was based on the same discount-from-value approach. He was willing to accept greater peaks and valleys of performance, and he happens to be a fellow whose whole psyche goes toward concentration, with the results shown. Incidentally, this record belongs to Charlie Munger, my partner for a long time in the operation of Berkshire Hathaway. When he ran his partnership, however, his portfolio holdings were almost completely different from mine and the other fellows mentioned earlier.

<br>

表6来自查理芒格的一个老友，另一个非商学院毕业的伙计，在南加州大学学的数学。他在毕业以后去IBM上班了，在IBM当了一阵子的推销员。当我认识芒格的时候，芒格认识了他。这是里克盖琳的投资记录。里克，从1965年到1983年，共计超出标普316%，最终收益是22,200%。也许是因为他没在商学院读过书，他管这叫做统计学显著。

Table 6 is the record of a fellow who was a pal of Charlie Munger’s — another non-business school type — who was a math major at USC. He went to work for IBM after graduation and was an IBM salesman for a while. After I got to Charlie, Charlie got to him. This happens to be the record of Rick Guerin. Rick, from 1965 to 1983, against a compounded gain of 316 percent for the S&P, came off with 22,200 percent, which probably because he lacks a business school education, he regards as statistically significant.

![](https://i.imgur.com/1xoaz8H.png)

<br>

在这里歪一下楼：我发现一个奇怪的一点就是人们要么瞬间就接受这种用40美分买出1美元的效果的投资策略，要么就永远没办法理解。这件事就像是打疫苗。如果没办法立即生效，那么你用几年时间的口舌和数据也没办法说服他。他们似乎就是没办法理解这样的概念，哪怕看起来不复杂。一个像里克盖琳的哥们，没经历过系统的商学院教育，“里克”就明白了这种价值投资策略，然后就在五分钟以后开始运用了。我从来没见过一个人在十年的过程中慢慢转化成一个价值投资者。似乎和IQ或者上课学了什么没关系。要么秒懂，要么不懂。

One sidelight here: it is extraordinary to me that the idea of buying dollar bills for 40 cents takes immediately to people or it doesn’t take at all. It’s like an inoculation. If it doesn’t grab a person right away, I find that you can talk to him for years and show him records, and it doesn’t make any difference. They just don’t seem able to grasp the concept, simple as it is. A fellow like Rick Guerin, who had no formal education in business, understands immediately the value approach to investing and he’s applying it five minutes later. I’ve never seen anyone who became a gradual convert over a ten-year period to this approach. It doesn’t seem to be a matter of IQ or academic training. It’s instant recognition, or it is nothing.

<br>

表7是斯坦珀尔米特的记录。斯坦在密西根大学读的是博雅专业，是博泽尔雅各布斯广告公司的合伙人。我们恰好在同一个大厦里上班。1965年他觉得我的商业模式更加适合他，所以他不搞广告了。同样的，5分钟内斯坦就接受了价值投资。

Table 7 is the record of Stan Perlmeter. Stan was a liberal arts major at the University of Michigan who was a partner in the advertising agency of Bozell & Jacobs. We happened to be in the same building in Omaha. In 1965 he figured out I had a better business than he did, so he left advertising. Again, it took five minutes for Stan to embrace the value approach.

珀尔米特和华特施洛斯的持股不同。他和比尔鲁恩的持股也不同。他们的投资决策是独立的。但是每一次珀尔米特买入一只股票都是因为他获得的比投入的更多。这是他唯一考虑的事情。他不考虑季度利润预测，他不考虑次年的利润预测，他不考虑其他公司的投资研究部门的观点，他不考虑股票趋势，成交量，或者其他的。他满脑子只有一个问题：这个公司值多少？

Perlmeter does not own what Walter Schloss owns. He does not own what Bill Ruane owns. These are records made independently. But every time Perlmeter buys a stock it’s because he’s getting more for his money than he’s paying. That’s the only thing he’s thinking about. He’s not looking at quarterly earnings projections, he’s not looking at next year’s earnings, he’s not thinking about what day of the week it is, he doesn’t care what investment research from any place says, he’s not interested in price momentum, volume, or anything. He’s simply asking: What is the business worth?

表8和表9是我有参与的两个养老基金。他们并不是我从一群有关联的养老基金里面选出来的；他们是我唯二能够影响其决策的基金。这两个基金我唆使他们进行价值投资。非常非常少的养老基金愿意选择价值投资的思路。表8是华盛顿时报的养老基金。之前是一家大银行帮他们管理，然后我建议他们选择一些价值投资经理来达到更好的效果。

Table 8 and Table 9 are the records of two pension funds I’ve been involved in. They are not selected from dozens of pension funds with which I have had involvement; they are the only two I have influenced. In both cases I have steered them toward value-oriented managers. Very, very few pension funds are managed from a value standpoint. Table 8 is the Washington Post Company’s Pension Fund. It was with a large bank some years ago, and I suggested that they would do well to select managers who had a value orientation.

你可以看到的是，总体而言在他们转变投资方向以后他们能达到最好的那1%。华盛顿时报让这些经理们至少为债券保留25%的资金，这并不一定会是这些经理想要的情况。因此，我也附加了债券的收益情况，来证明他们并没有厉害的债券投资能力。他们也不会装作好像很懂的样子。带着这25%的资金限制，他们依然是资产管理界的前1%。华盛顿时报的业绩并没有非常长的时间跨度，但是也反映了这三个经理的多个投资决策。这些经理并不是我事后单独挑的。

As you can see, overall they have been in the top percentile ever since they made the change. The Post told the managers to keep at least 25 percent of these funds in bonds, which would not have been necessarily the choice of these managers. So, I’ve included the bond performance simply to illustrate that this group has no particular expertise about bonds. They wouldn’t have said they did. Even with this drag of 25 percent of their fund in an area that was not their game, they were in the top percentile of fund management. The Washington Post experience does not cover a terribly long period but it does represent many investment decisions by three managers who were not identified retroactively.

<br>

表9是食品制造机械公司的基金。我没有参与任何实际的管理，但是我在1974年和他们说选择一些价值投资者作为经理。在此之前，他们选择基金经理的方式和大部分大公司差不多。自从他们转变到了价值投资方向以后，他们现在在贝克养老基金排行榜上的当前规模组内排名第一。去年他们有8位投资经理任期长达1年以上。其中的7位的累计收益超过标普。全部8位经理去年的收益率都超过了标普。行业收益中位数和食品制造机械公司的基金的差距是2.43亿美金。食品制造机械公司将这归功于选择投资经理的方法。这些经理不一定是我会选的，但是他们的共同特点是价值为基础的选股方法。

Table 9 is the record of the FMC Corporation fund. I don’t manage a dime of it myself but I did, in 1974, influence their decision to select value-oriented managers. Prior to that time they had selected managers much the same way as most larger companies. They now rank number one in the Becker survey of pension funds for their size over the period of time subsequent to this “conversion” to the value approach. Last year they had eight equity managers of any duration beyond a year. Seven of them had a cumulative record better than the S&P. All eight had a better record last year than the S&P. The net difference now between a median performance and the actual performance of the FMC fund over this period is $243 million. FMC attributes this to the mindset given to them about the selection of managers. Those managers are not the managers I would necessarily select but they have the common denominators of selecting securities based on value.

这就是9位格雷汉姆-多德市的村民的投资记录。我并不是从上千个投资者中甄选出的。并不是说我把那些中了彩票的幸运儿罗列出来，以至于我可能甚至都不认识他们。这些都是我在几年前基于他们的投资决策思路而选择的。我知道他们从哪学到这些知识，而且我也私下了解到他们的智慧，秉性，以及性情。非常重要的一点事，这一组人群承受了比平均值远低的风险；可以注意到他们在市场低迷时期的表现。尽管他们的投资风格不同，这些投资者的心态总是基于买入公司而不是买入股票。他们其中的一部分有时候更多地选择控股而不是参股。他们的态度，无论是买入整个公司还是仅仅一部分，都是相同的。他们之中的一部分持有为数不多的股票；其他的选择分散化。但是他们都选择了利用市场价值和内在价值之间的差异。

So these are nine records of “coin-flippers” from Graham-and-Doddsville. I haven’t selected them with hindsight from among thousands. It’s not like I am reciting to you the names of a bunch of lottery winners — people I had never heard of before they won the lottery. I selected these men years ago based upon their framework for investment decision-making. I knew what they had been taught and additionally I had some personal knowledge of their intellect, character, and temperament. It’s very important to understand that this group has assumed far less risk than average; note their record in years when the general market was weak. While they differ greatly in style, these investors are, mentally, always buying the business, not buying the stock. A few of them sometimes buy whole businesses far more often they simply buy small pieces of businesses. Their attitude, whether buying all or a tiny piece of a business, is the same. Some of them hold portfolios with dozens of stocks; others concentrate on a handful. But all exploit the difference between the market price of a business and its intrinsic value.

<br>

我相信股票市场存在一定程度的失效，所以那些格雷汉姆-多德市的投资者们能够成功利用价格和价值的不对等。当股票的价格可以被华尔街最易激动的人，最贪婪的人，或者最沮丧的人所影响，那么很难说市场的价格总是合理。实际上，市场的价格常常不讲道理。

I’m convinced that there is much inefficiency in the market. These Graham-and-Doddsville investors have successfully exploited gaps between price and value. When the price of a stock can be influenced by a “herd” on Wall Street with prices set at the margin by the most emotional person, or the greediest person, or the most depressed person, it is hard to argue that the market always prices rationally. In fact, market prices are frequently nonsensical.

<br>

关于风险收益，我想要划一个重点。有时候风险收益是呈现正相关的。如果有人和我说，“我有一个六发试左轮手枪，只有一颗子弹。你愿意参与这俄罗斯转盘游戏吗？如果你侥幸活下来，我会给你1百万。”如果我第一次听到这个机会，其实我是拒绝的。然后他将赌注上提到5百万，条件是拨动两次扳机，这样一来明显感觉到风险收益是呈现正比的了！

I would like to say one important thing about risk and reward. Sometimes risk and reward are correlated in a positive fashion. If someone were to say to me, “I have here a six-shooter and I have slipped one cartridge into it. Why don’t you just spin it and pull it once? If you survive, I will give you $1 million.” I would decline — perhaps stating that $1 million is not enough. Then he might offer me $5 million to pull the trigger twice — now that would be a positive correlation between risk and reward!

<br>

价值投资则是恰恰相反。60美分买入1美元的风险比40美分买入1美元的风险要大，但是期望收益却是后者更高。价值投资组合的潜在的收益越高，风险越低。

The exact opposite is true with value investing. If you buy a dollar bill for 60 cents, it’s riskier than if you buy a dollar bill for 40 cents, but the expectation of reward is greater in the latter case. The greater the potential for reward in the value portfolio, the less risk there is.

<br>

一个简单的例子：华盛顿邮报在1973年的市值是8千万美金。在那时，你可以将公司的资产以4亿美金甚至更多的价格卖给十个买家之中的任何一位。邮报的持股有新闻周刊，还有一系列的大型的新闻电视台。这些资产的价值如今已经是20亿美金，所以如果有人当初愿意支付4亿美金也没毛病。

One quick example: The Washington Post Company in 1973 was selling for $80 million in the market. At the time, that day, you could have sold the assets to any one of ten buyers for not less than $400 million, probably appreciably more. The company owned the Post, Newsweek, plus several television stations in major markets. Those same properties are worth $2 billion now, so the person who would have paid $400 million would not have been crazy.

<br>

如果当时股票的价格持续下跌至4千万的估值而不是8千万，那么这个公司的beta将会更高。对于那些认为beta相当于风险的人，更低的价格意味着更高的风险。这明显是他们想多了。我从来没搞明白为什么用4千万买入4亿的资产会比8千万的风险更大。同样的，如果你是在买股票，而你对这个公司的价值足够了解，那么对你来说以8千万买入4亿资产基本没有风险，更何况你是分成10份，每8百万对应4千万。因为你对这4千万没有直接控制权，所以你希望你选择的是诚实可靠的管理者，但是这并不是一件困难的事情。

Now, if the stock had declined even further to a price that made the valuation $40 million instead of $80 million, its beta would have been greater. And to people that think beta measures risk, the cheaper price would have made it look riskier. This is truly Alice in Wonderland. I have never been able to figure out why it’s riskier to buy $400 million worth of properties for $40 million than $80 million. And, as a matter of fact, if you buy a group of such securities and you know anything at all about business valuation, there is essentially no risk in buying $400 million for $80 million, particularly if you do it by buying ten $40 million piles of $8 million each. Since you don’t have your hands on the $400 million, you want to be sure you are in with honest and reasonably competent people, but that’s not a difficult job.

<br>

你需要对公司的价值有一个大致的概念，但是并不需要很精确。这就是本格雷汉姆所说的安全边际。你不会想办法用8千万买入8.3千万的资产。你需要保留一定的余地。当你搭一座桥，你的目标是承重3万磅，但是真正你只允许1万磅的货车通过。投资的原则也是类似。

You also have to have the knowledge to enable you to make a very general estimate about the value of the underlying businesses. But you do not cut it close. That is what Ben Graham meant by having a margin of safety. You don’t try and buy businesses worth $83 million for $80 million. You leave yourself an enormous margin. When you build a bridge, you insist it can carry 30,000 pounds, but you only drive 10,000 pound trucks across it. And that same principle works in investing.

<br>

在最后，你们的其中可能会在评论区留言说为什么没人邀请就来回答。说服别人入坑价值投资不可避会减少价值投资的机会。我只能说自从本格雷汉姆和大卫多德在《证券分析》里第一次提到以后，50年过去了价值投资依然也没有成为主流。在我35年来的工作过程中没看到这样的苗头。人们似乎总是喜欢将简单的问题复杂化。学术界，实际上在过去的30年内开倒车。很有可能未来还是会继续。有人会坐船环球旅行也有人会相信地球是平的。价格和价值的偏离还将继续，那些信格雷汉姆和多德的人运气不会太差。

In conclusion, some of the more commercially minded among you may wonder why I am writing this article. Adding many converts to the value approach will perforce narrow the spreads between price and value. I can only tell you that the secret has been out for 50 years, ever since Ben Graham and Dave Dodd wrote Security Analysis, yet I have seen no trend toward value investing in the 35 years that I’ve practiced it. There seems to be some perverse human characteristic that likes to make easy things difficult. The academic world, if anything, has actually backed away from the teaching of value investing over the last 30 years. It’s likely to continue that way. Ships will sail around the world but the Flat Earth Society will flourish. There will continue to be wide discrepancies between price and value in the marketplace, and those who read their Graham & Dodd will continue to prosper.
