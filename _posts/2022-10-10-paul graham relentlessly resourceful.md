几天前，我终于将成为优秀的创业者的特质归结为两个字：无情的足智多谋。

A couple days ago I finally got being a good startup founder down to two words: relentlessly resourceful.

在那之前，我能做到的最好的做法就是把与之相反的品质归结于一点：无望。 大多数字典都说无望意味着不幸。 但是字典做得不是很好。 一支在比赛中胜过对手但因裁判失误而输掉比赛的球队可能被称为不幸，但并非无望。 无望意味着被动。 无望就是被环境重创，对世界逆来顺受，而不是与其成长。 [1]

Till then the best I'd managed was to get the opposite quality down to one: hapless. Most dictionaries say hapless means unlucky. But the dictionaries are not doing a very good job. A team that outplays its opponents but loses because of a bad decision by the referee could be called unlucky, but not hapless. Hapless implies passivity. To be hapless is to be battered by circumstances—to let the world have its way with you, instead of having your way with the world. [1]

不幸的是，无望没有反义词，这使得很难告诉创始人目标是什么。 “不要无望”并不是什么口号。

Unfortunately there's no antonym of hapless, which makes it difficult to tell founders what to aim for. "Don't be hapless" is not much of rallying cry.

表达我们在隐喻中寻找的品质并不难。 最好的可能是跑卫。 一个好的跑卫不仅是坚定的，而且是灵活的。 他们想进入低场，但他们会在比赛中调整他们的计划。

It's not hard to express the quality we're looking for in metaphors. The best is probably a running back. A good running back is not merely determined, but flexible as well. They want to get downfield, but they adapt their plans on the fly.

不幸的是，这只是一个比喻，对美国以外的大多数人来说并没有什么用处。 “像个跑卫”并不比“别无望”好。

Unfortunately this is just a metaphor, and not a useful one to most people outside the US. "Be like a running back" is no better than "Don't be hapless."

但最后我想出了如何直接表达这种品质。 我当时正在为投资者写一篇演讲，我不得不解释在创始人身上寻找什么。 与无望相反的人会是什么样子？ 他们会无情地足智多谋。 不仅仅是无情。 除了一些最无趣的领域外，这还不足以让事情顺利进行。 在任何有趣的领域，困难都是全新的。 这意味着您不能简单地通过它们，因为您最初不知道它们有多难； 你不知道你是要穿过一块泡沫还是花岗岩。 所以你必须足智多谋。 你必须不断尝试新事物。

But finally I've figured out how to express this quality directly. I was writing a talk for investors, and I had to explain what to look for in founders. What would someone who was the opposite of hapless be like? They'd be relentlessly resourceful. Not merely relentless. That's not enough to make things go your way except in a few mostly uninteresting domains. In any interesting domain, the difficulties will be novel. Which means you can't simply plow through them, because you don't know initially how hard they are; you don't know whether you're about to plow through a block of foam or granite. So you have to be resourceful. You have to keep trying new things.

无情地足智多谋。

Be relentlessly resourceful.

这听起来是对的，但它只是对如何取得成功的陈词滥调的说法吗？ 我不这么认为。 例如，这不是写作或绘画成功的秘诀。 在那种工作中，成功的方法更多的是积极好奇。 足智多谋意味着障碍是外部的，它们通常存在于初创公司中。 但在写作和绘画中，它们大多是内在的； 障碍是你自己的迟钝。 [2]

That sounds right, but is it simply a description of how to be successful in general? I don't think so. This isn't the recipe for success in writing or painting, for example. In that kind of work the recipe is more to be actively curious. Resourceful implies the obstacles are external, which they generally are in startups. But in writing and painting they're mostly internal; the obstacle is your own obtuseness. [2]
