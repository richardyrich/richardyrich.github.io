原文标题：Why to Start a Startup in a Bad Economy

<br>

<br>

经济形势显然如此严峻，以至于一些专家担心我们可能会陷入与七十年代中期一样糟糕的时期。

The economic situation is apparently so grim that some experts fear we may be in for a stretch as bad as the mid seventies.

<br>

但是如果我们考虑微软和苹果公司的例子，正如这些例子所表明的那样，经济衰退可能不是创业的糟糕时机。同时，我也不是说经济萧条时期一个特别好的创业时期。一个无聊的事实是：无论哪种方式，经济状况都无关紧要。

When Microsoft and Apple were founded. As those examples suggest, a recession may not be such a bad time to start a startup. I'm not claiming it's a particularly good time either. The truth is more boring: the state of the economy doesn't matter much either way.

<br>

如果我们从投资过这么多初创公司中学到一件事，那就是他们的成败取决于创始人的素质。当然，经济会产生一些影响，但作为成功的预测指标，与创始人自身素质带来的影响相比，经济环境是只能算数据噪点。

If we've learned one thing from funding so many startups, it's that they succeed or fail based on the qualities of the founders. The economy has some effect, certainly, but as a predictor of success it's rounding error compared to the founders.

<br>

这意味着重要的是你是谁，而不是你什么时候做。如果你是对的人，即使在经济不景气的情况下你也会成功。如果你不是，那么再好的经济也不会拯救你。那些认为“我现在最好不要创业，因为经济太糟糕了”的人所犯的错误与那些在泡沫时期认为“我要做的就是创业，我就会变得富有”的人一样。  

Which means that what matters is who you are, not when you do it. If you're the right sort of person, you'll win even in a bad economy. And if you're not, a good economy won't save you. Someone who thinks "I better not start a startup now, because the economy is so bad" is making the same mistake as the people who thought during the Bubble "all I have to do is start a startup, and I'll be rich."

<br>

因此，如果你想提高你的创业成功率，你应该更多地考虑你可以招募谁作为联合创始人，而不是经济状况。如果你担心初创公司的是否能够生存，请不要在新闻中寻找成功答案，而应该照照镜子。

So if you want to improve your chances, you should think far more about who you can recruit as a cofounder than the state of the economy. And if you're worried about threats to the survival of your company, don't look for them in the news. Look in the mirror.

<br>

但你可能会问：对于任何创始人团队来说，等到经济好转后再迈出这一步难道不值得吗？如果你正在开一家餐馆，也许可以，但如果你是一个技术型创业团队，那就不行了。技术的进步或多或少独立于股票市场。因此，对于任何给定的想法，在经济不景气的情况下立即行动带来的回报将高于继续等待。微软的第一个产品是为微型计算机 Altair编写相匹配的BASIC解释器。这正是 1975 年对应的时代所需要的，但如果盖茨和艾伦决定再等几年，那就太迟了。

But for any given team of founders, would it not pay to wait till the economy is better before taking the leap? If you're starting a restaurant, maybe, but not if you're working on technology. Technology progresses more or less independently of the stock market. So for any given idea, the payoff for acting fast in a bad economy will be higher than for waiting. Microsoft's first product was a Basic interpreter for the Altair. That was exactly what the world needed in 1975, but if Gates and Allen had decided to wait a few years, it would have been too late.

<br>

当然，你现在拥有的想法不会是你的最后一个想法。你总是有想到新的创业想法。但是，如果您有具体的想法想要采取行动的话，那就从今天立即行动。

Of course, the idea you have now won't be the last you have. There are always new ideas. But if you have a specific idea you want to act on, act now.

<br>

这并不意味着你可以忽视经济。客户和投资者都会在经济萧条时期感到压力。如果客户在当前的经济环境感到紧张，这不一定是问题：您甚至可以通过提供廉价的产品从中受益。初创公司通常会使事情变得更便宜，因此在这方面考虑，它们比大公司更能在经济衰退中获得成功。

That doesn't mean you can ignore the economy. Both customers and investors will be feeling pinched. It's not necessarily a problem if customers feel pinched: you may even be able to benefit from it, by making things that save money. Startups often make things cheaper, so in that respect they're better positioned to prosper in a recession than big companies.

<br>

经济危机对投资者的问题更大。初创公司通常需要筹集一定数量的外部资金，而投资者往往不太愿意在糟糕的时期进行投资。但是这么做不应该。每个人都知道你应该在糟糕的时候买入，在好的时候卖出。但当然，让投资如此反直觉的是，在股市中，好时机被定义为每个人都认为是时候买入了。你必须是一个逆向投资者才能正确。因此，根据定义，只有少数投资者可以真的成为逆向投资者。

Investors are more of a problem. Startups generally need to raise some amount of external funding, and investors tend to be less willing to invest in bad times. They shouldn't be. Everyone knows you're supposed to buy when times are bad and sell when times are good. But of course what makes investing so counterintuitive is that in equity markets, good times are defined as everyone thinking it's time to buy. You have to be a contrarian to be correct, and by definition only a minority of investors can be.

<br>

因此，正如 1999 年的投资者相互拥挤试图购买糟糕的初创公司一样，2009 年的投资者可能也不愿投资于好的初创公司。

So just as investors in 1999 were tripping over one another trying to buy into lousy startups, investors in 2009 will presumably be reluctant to invest even in good ones.

<br>

你必须适应这一点。但这并不是什么新鲜事：初创公司总是必须适应投资者的一时冲动。如果你问不同经济环境创业中的创始人，你是否认为投资者是善变的，你可以很快注意到他们马上会变得很激动。可能去年你必须准备好解释你的创业公司是如何成长的，而明年你将不得不解释它会如何抵御衰退。

You'll have to adapt to this. But that's nothing new: startups always have to adapt to the whims of investors. Ask any founder in any economy if they'd describe investors as fickle, and watch the face they make. Last year you had to be prepared to explain how your startup was viral. Next year you'll have to explain how it's recession-proof.

<br>

（这些都是好事。投资者犯的错误不是他们使用的标准不对，而是他们总是倾向于专注只用一个标准而排斥其他标准。）

(Those are both good things to be. The mistake investors make is not the criteria they use but that they always tend to focus on one to the exclusion of the rest.)

<br>

幸运的是，让初创公司抵御衰退的方法就是做你应该做的事情：尽可能低成本的运营。多年来，我一直告诉创始人，成功的最可靠途径是成为业界的蟑螂。创业公司死亡的直接原因总是没钱。因此，您的公司运营成本越低，就越难杀死。幸运的是，如今的时代，经营一家初创公司非常便宜。而经济衰退只会将这件事变得更便宜。

Fortunately the way to make a startup recession-proof is to do exactly what you should do anyway: run it as cheaply as possible. For years I've been telling founders that the surest route to success is to be the cockroaches of the corporate world. The immediate cause of death in a startup is always running out of money. So the cheaper your company is to operate, the harder it is to kill. And fortunately it has gotten very cheap to run a startup. A recession will if anything make it cheaper still.

<br>

如果经济的核冬天真的来了，做一只蟑螂可能比保住工作更安全。如果客户不再负担您的费用，他们其中的一部分可能会放弃，但您不会一下子立刻失去你所有的客户；你的市场不会出现“裁员”。

If nuclear winter really is here, it may be safer to be a cockroach even than to keep your job. Customers may drop off individually if they can no longer afford you, but you're not going to lose them all at once; markets don't "reduce headcount."

<br>

如果你辞掉工作，创办失败，但又找不到下一份工作怎么办？如果你从事销售或营销工作，这可能是个问题。在这些领域，在经济不景气的情况下可能需要几个月的时间才能找到一份新工作。但技术性人才似乎更具流动性。优秀的技术人才总能找到某种工作。这可能不是你梦寐以求的工作，但你至少不会挨饿。

What if you quit your job to start a startup that fails, and you can't find another? That could be a problem if you work in sales or marketing. In those fields it can take months to find a new job in a bad economy. But hackers seem to be more liquid. Good hackers can always get some kind of job. It might not be your dream job, but you're not going to starve.

<br>

糟糕时期的另一个优势是竞争较少。科技发展的列车总是定期离开车站。如果其他人都蜷缩在角落里，你可能会成为唯一那个上车的人。

Another advantage of bad times is that there's less competition. Technology trains leave the station at regular intervals. If everyone else is cowering in a corner, you may have a whole car to yourself.

<br>

创业者也是投资人。作为创始人，你是在用劳动换取股票：拉里和谢尔盖如此富有的原因，与其说他们做了数百亿美元的工作，不如说他们是谷歌的第一批投资者。就像任何投资者一样，你应该在糟糕的时候买入。

You're an investor too. As a founder, you're buying stock with work: the reason Larry and Sergey are so rich is not so much that they've done work worth tens of billions of dollars, but that they were the first investors in Google. And like any investor you should buy when times are bad.

<br>

在这篇文章的先前段落，当我谈到即使是理性上最愿意购买的时候，投资者也不愿意在糟糕的市场中向初创公司投入资金时，你是否在点头表示同意，并认为是“愚蠢的投资者”？好吧，创始人也好不到哪里去。当情况变糟时，那些潜在创业者会去读研究生。毫无疑问，这一次经济危机我们也会看到类似的情况。事实上，这篇文章的前一段如此说到大家心坎的原因是，大多数读者不会相信它——或者即使他们相信了，也不敢付出实际行动。

Were you nodding in agreement, thinking "stupid investors" a few paragraphs ago when I was talking about how investors are reluctant to put money into startups in bad markets, even though that's the time they should rationally be most willing to buy? Well, founders aren't much better. When times get bad, hackers go to grad school. And no doubt that will happen this time too. In fact, what makes the preceding paragraph true is that most readers won't believe it—at least to the extent of acting on it.

<br>

因此，也许经济衰退是创业的好时机。很难说缺乏竞争等优势是否超过了不情愿的投资者的劣势。但这并不重要，重要的是创业者自己。对于从事技术的技术性创业者，采取行动的时间总是现在。

So maybe a recession is a good time to start a startup. It's hard to say whether advantages like lack of competition outweigh disadvantages like reluctant investors. But it doesn't matter much either way. It's the people that matter. And for a given set of people working on a given technology, the time to act is always now.
