在我们的眼皮底下，有很多尚未被尝试的伟大创业想法。 我们看不到它们的一个原因是一种我称之为琐事盲视（Schlep Blindness）的现象。 Schlep 最初是意第绪语的词汇（Yiddish，维基百科：属于日耳曼语族。全球大约有三百万使用者，大部分为犹太人，而且其中主要是阿什肯纳兹犹太人。），但已在美国普遍使用。 意味着一项乏味、不愉快的任务。

There are great startup ideas lying around unexploited right under our noses. One reason we don't see them is a phenomenon I call schlep blindness. Schlep was originally a Yiddish word but has passed into general use in the US. It means a tedious, unpleasant task.

<br>

没有人喜欢琐事，但黑客们尤其不喜欢它们（保罗·格雷厄姆喜欢称呼电脑工程师为黑客）。 大多数初创公司的黑客希望他们可以通过编写一些聪明的软件，将其放在某个服务器上，然后看着钱滚滚而来——而不必与用户交谈，或与其他公司谈判，或与其他人的糟糕的代码打交道。 也许这种情况是可能的，但我还没有看到过。

No one likes schleps, but hackers especially dislike them. Most hackers who start startups wish they could do it by just writing some clever software, putting it on a server somewhere, and watching the money roll in—without ever having to talk to users, or negotiate with other companies, or deal with other people's broken code. Maybe that's possible, but I haven't seen it.

<br>

我们在 Y Combinator 做的许多事情之一就是向黑客传授琐事的必然性。 不，你不能仅通过编写代码来做一个创业公司。 我记得我自己也经历过这种认识。 在 1995 年的某个时刻，我仍在努力说服自己我可以通过编写代码来创办一家公司。 但我很快从经验中了解到，琐事不仅是不可避免的，而且几乎是业务的组成部分。 一家公司是由它将承担的责任来定义的。 处理琐事应该像面对冰冷的游泳池一样：就跳进去吧。这并不是说你应该寻找不愉快的工作本身，但如果它出现在你寻找某个伟大的事情路上，那你不应该退缩 。

One of the many things we do at Y Combinator is teach hackers about the inevitability of schleps. No, you can't start a startup by just writing code. I remember going through this realization myself. There was a point in 1995 when I was still trying to convince myself I could start a company by just writing code. But I soon learned from experience that schleps are not merely inevitable, but pretty much what business consists of. A company is defined by the schleps it will undertake. And schleps should be dealt with the same way you'd deal with a cold swimming pool: just jump in. Which is not to say you should seek out unpleasant work per se, but that you should never shrink from it if it's on the path to something great.

<br>

我们不喜欢琐事最危险的地方在于这种想法大部分是无意识的。 你的潜意识甚至不会让你看到涉及到痛苦的琐事的想法。琐事盲视就是这样出现了。

The most dangerous thing about our dislike of schleps is that much of it is unconscious. Your unconscious won't even let you see ideas that involve painful schleps. That's schlep blindness.

<br>

这种现象不仅限于初创公司。 例如，大多数人不会有意识地决定让自己的体格不如奥运会运动员。 他们的潜意识为他们做决定，使得他们避开能够达成这样的体能的训练。

The phenomenon isn't limited to startups. Most people don't consciously decide not to be in as good physical shape as Olympic athletes, for example. Their unconscious mind decides for them, shrinking from the work involved.

<br>

我所知道的关于琐事盲视的最引人注目的例子是Stripe，或者更确切地说是Stripe的想法。 十多年来，每个不得不在线处理支付的黑客都知道这种经历是多么痛苦。 成千上万的人一定知道这个问题。 然而，当Stripe他们开始创业时，他们决定建立食谱网站或当地活动的信息整合门户。 为什么？ 当你可以修复世界基础设施中最重要的组成部分之一时，为什么还要解决很少有人关心且没人愿意为此付费的问题呢？ 因为琐事盲视让人们甚至无法考虑解决付款的想法。

The most striking example I know of schlep blindness is Stripe, or rather Stripe's idea. For over a decade, every hacker who'd ever had to process payments online knew how painful the experience was. Thousands of people must have known about this problem. And yet when they started startups, they decided to build recipe sites, or aggregators for local events. Why? Why work on problems few care much about and no one will pay for, when you could fix one of the most important components of the world's infrastructure? Because schlep blindness prevented people from even considering the idea of fixing payments.

<br>

可能没有人向 Y Combinator 提交申请做一个食谱网站上的时候，想到的第一个问题就是“我们应该解决付款问题，还是建立一个食谱网站？” 并选择了食谱网站。 尽管解决付款问题的想法就在眼前，但他们从未看到过，因为他们的潜意识因所涉及的复杂性而退缩了。 你必须与银行进行交易。 这应该如何是好？ 另外，你正在转移资金，因此你将不得不处理欺诈行为以及试图闯入你的服务器的人。 另外，可能还有各种各样的法规要遵守。 创办这样的初创公司比开设食谱网站要可怕得多。

Probably no one who applied to Y Combinator to work on a recipe site began by asking "should we fix payments, or build a recipe site?" and chose the recipe site. Though the idea of fixing payments was right there in plain sight, they never saw it, because their unconscious mind shrank from the complications involved. You'd have to make deals with banks. How do you do that? Plus you're moving money, so you're going to have to deal with fraud, and people trying to break into your servers. Plus there are probably all sorts of regulations to comply with. It's a lot more intimidating to start a startup like this than a recipe site.

<br>

人们的这种恐惧感让那些雄心勃勃的想法倍增价值。 除了这个想法自身的内在价值以外，因为初创公司的创始人很少想要去解决它们，它们就像被低估的股票。 如果你选择了一个雄心勃勃的想法，你的竞争就会减少，因为其他人都会被所涉及的挑战吓跑。 （一般来说，决定创业这件事情本身也是如此。）

That scariness makes ambitious ideas doubly valuable. In addition to their intrinsic value, they're like undervalued stocks in the sense that there's less demand for them among founders. If you pick an ambitious idea, you'll have less competition, because everyone else will have been frightened off by the challenges involved. (This is also true of starting a startup generally.)

<br>

你如何克服琐事盲视？ 坦率地说，对琐事盲视最有价值的解药可能是无知。 大多数成功的创始人可能会说，如果他们在创办公司时就知道他们必须克服的障碍，他们可能永远不会开始创业。 也许这就是最成功的创业公司经常是年轻创始人的原因之一。

How do you overcome schlep blindness? Frankly, the most valuable antidote to schlep blindness is probably ignorance. Most successful founders would probably say that if they'd known when they were starting their company about the obstacles they'd have to overcome, they might never have started it. Maybe that's one reason the most successful startups of all so often have young founders.

<br>

在实际情况中，创始人会随着问题而成长。 但似乎没有人能够预见到这一点，即使是更年长、更有经验的创始人也是如此。 所以年轻的创始人有优势的原因是他们犯了两个相互抵消的错误。 他们不知道他们可以成长多少，但他们也不知道他们需要成长多少。 年长的创始人只会犯第一个错误。

In practice the founders grow with the problems. But no one seems able to foresee that, not even older, more experienced founders. So the reason younger founders have an advantage is that they make two mistakes that cancel each other out. They don't know how much they can grow, but they also don't know how much they'll need to. Older founders only make the first mistake.

<br>

然而，无知并不能解决一切。 有些想法显然会让任何人都可以看到其令人震惊的琐碎。 你如何辨别这样的想法？ 我推荐的技巧是把自己抽离出来。 不去问“我应该解决什么问题？” 而是问“我希望别人为我解决什么问题？” 如果在 Stripe 出现之前，必须处理付款的人做工作的过程中，他们最希望有的事情里，Stripe是其中之一。

Ignorance can't solve everything though. Some ideas so obviously entail alarming schleps that anyone can see them. How do you see ideas like that? The trick I recommend is to take yourself out of the picture. Instead of asking "what problem should I solve?" ask "what problem do I wish someone else would solve for me?" If someone who had to process payments before Stripe had tried asking that, Stripe would have been one of the first things they wished for.

<br>

现在做第二个Stripe 为时已晚，但如果你知道如何看待琐事盲视，世界上仍然有很多问题等待你去解决。

It's too late now to be Stripe, but there's plenty still broken in the world, if you know how to see it.
