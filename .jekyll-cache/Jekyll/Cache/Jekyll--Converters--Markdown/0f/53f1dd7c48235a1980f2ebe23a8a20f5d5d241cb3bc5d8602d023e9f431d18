Warren Buffett: We always have problems. But, Muhtar, the luckiest person, on a probability basis, in my view, thatâ€™s ever been born in the history of the world, is the baby being born the United States today. Just think about it in 1790, we had four million people here and there were hundreds of millions of people in the world. We werenâ€™t smarter and we didnâ€™t even work harder than other people are necessarily. But we had a system that unleashed human potential and that system â€“ quality of opportunity, a rule of a market system as produced in abundance, you canâ€™t believe I mean just just look about you think about what this looked like 200 years ago. There wasnâ€™t anything here basically and it improves the standard of living in my lifetime six for one. So we weâ€™ve got the formula and it hasnâ€™t been exhausted remotely. Just look at whatâ€™s happened in the last 15 or 20 years, we keep turning out people like Steve Jobs and thatâ€™ll continue.</p>

Weâ€™ll always have problems. Ever since I got out of school, I used to sell stocks. People always give me ten reasons why you shouldnâ€™t buy them. Youâ€™ve heard them all throughout your life but the world does not belong to the pessimists, believe me. Youâ€™re selling happiness. Having it at armâ€™s length away is a big part of it. The distribution systems been developed. Itâ€™s the right formula, Muhtar. It just has to be carried out with extreme diligence enthusiasm and every minute of the day</p>
