<p>Hi, Iâ€™m Marisa Pont Iâ€™m a senior management major. Obviously as a public what we hear most about are your successful investing adventures or the new products that you develop that work out. I was just wondering what is what would you consider to be the worst investment youâ€™ve ever made?</p>

<p>Warren Buffett: The worst investment I ever made? How long do you have? [Laughter] well Iâ€™ve made some very bad ones but that doesnâ€™t really bother me. It may bother the shareholders but thatâ€™s another question. you know youâ€™re going to make mistakes in life. Thereâ€™s no question about it. You donâ€™t want to make them on the big decisions. You know who you marry and some things like that.</p>

<p>Thereâ€™s no way Iâ€™m going to make a lot of business and investment decisions without making some mistakes. I may try to minimize them I donâ€™t dwell on them at all. I donâ€™t look back.</p>

<p>The biggest mistakes are the ones that actually donâ€™t show up. Theyâ€™re the mistakes of omission rather than commission. weâ€™ve never lost that much money on any one investment, but itâ€™s the things that I knew enough to do that I didnâ€™t do. We have missed profits of as much as maybe 10 billion dollars in things that I knew enough to do. And I didnâ€™t do. Now the fact that I didnâ€™t buy Microsoft way back is not a foregone opportunity because I didnâ€™t know enough to make that decision. But there have been other investments where I did know enough to make the decision and for one reason or another I either didnâ€™t do it at all or I did it on a small scale. I was sucking my thumb when I should have been writing checks</p>

<p>Those donâ€™t show up. Thereâ€™s no place where it shows â€œmissed opportunitiesâ€. But Iâ€™ve missed some big ones. The triumphs in life are partly triumphs because you know that everything isnâ€™t going to be a triumph. I would never get too hung up on mistakes. I know a lot of people that really agonize over them. It just isnâ€™t worth it. Tomorrow is another day, and you live it forward and just go on to the next thing.</p>
