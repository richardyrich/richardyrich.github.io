<p>Here are 13 thoughts about how to achieve such outlier success. Everything here is easier to do once youâ€™ve already reached a baseline degree of success (through privilege or effort) and want to put in the work to turn that into outlier success. [1] But much of it applies to anyone.</p>

<p>A medium-sized business that grows 50% in value every year becomes huge in a very short amount of time. Few businesses in the world have true network effects and extreme scalability. But with technology, more and more will.  Itâ€™s worth a lot of effort to find them and create them.</p>

<p>You donâ€™t want to be in a career where people who have been doing it for two years can be as effective as people who have been doing it for twentyâ€”your rate of learning should always be high. As your career progresses, each unit of work you do should generate more and more results. There are many ways to get this leverage, such as capital, technology, brand, network effects, and managing people.</p>

<p>Itâ€™s useful to focus on adding another zero to whatever you define as your success metricâ€”money, status, impact on the world, or whatever. I am willing to take as much time as needed between projects to find my next thing.

<p>I think the biggest competitive advantage in businessâ€”either for a company or for an individualâ€™s careerâ€”is long-term thinking with a broad view of how different systems in the world are going to come together. One of the notable aspects of compound growth is that the furthest out years are the most important. In a world where almost no one takes a truly long-term view, the market richly rewards those who do.</p>

<p>I remember when Elon Musk took me on a tour of the SpaceX factory many years ago. He talked in detail about manufacturing every part of the rocket, but the thing that sticks in memory was the look of absolute certainty on his face when he talked about sending large rockets to Mars. I left thinking â€œhuh, so thatâ€™s the benchmark for what conviction looks like.â€</p>

<p>Managing your own moraleâ€”and your teamâ€™s moraleâ€”is one of the greatest challenges of most endeavors. Itâ€™s almost impossible without a lot of self-belief. And unfortunately, the more ambitious you are, the more the world will try to tear you down.</p>

<p>Self-belief must be balanced with self-awareness. I used to hate criticism of any sort and actively avoided it. Now I try to always listen to it with the assumption that itâ€™s true, and then decide if I want to act on it or not. Truth-seeking is hard and often painful, but it is what separates self-belief from self-delusion.</p>

<p>Most people overestimate risk and underestimate reward. Taking risks is important because itâ€™s impossible to be right all the timeâ€”you have to try many things and adapt quickly as you learn more.</p>

<p>Itâ€™s often easier to take risks early in your career; you donâ€™t have much to lose, and you potentially have a lot to gain. Once youâ€™ve gotten yourself to a point where you have your basic obligations covered you should try to make it easy to take risks. Look for small bets you can make where you lose 1x if youâ€™re wrong but make 100x if it works. Then make a bigger bet in that direction.</p>

<p>Donâ€™t save up for too long, though. At YC, weâ€™ve often noticed a problem with founders that have spent a lot of time working at Google or Facebook. When people get used to a comfortable life, a predictable job, and a reputation of succeeding at whatever they do, it gets very hard to leave that behind (and people have an incredible ability to always match their lifestyle to next yearâ€™s salary). Even if they do leave, the temptation to return is great. Itâ€™s easyâ€”and human natureâ€”to prioritize short-term gain and convenience over long-term fulfillment.</p>

<p>But when you arenâ€™t on the treadmill, you can follow your hunches and spend time on things that might turn out to be really interesting. Keeping your life cheap and flexible for as long as you can is a powerful way to do this, but obviously comes with tradeoffs.</p>

<p>And itâ€™s often really fun. One of the great joys in life is finding your purpose, excelling at it, and discovering that your impact matters to something larger than yourself. A YC founder recently expressed great surprise about how much happier and more fulfilled he was after leaving his job at a big company and working towards his maximum possible impact. Working hard at that should be celebrated.</p>

<p>One more thought about working hard: do it at the beginning of your career. Hard work compounds like interest, and the earlier you do it, the more time you have for the benefits to pay off. Itâ€™s also easier to work hard when you have fewer other responsibilities, which is frequently but not always the case when youâ€™re young.</p>

<p>An effective way to build a network is to help people as much as you can. Doing this, over a long period of time, is what lead to most of my best career opportunities and three of my four best investments. Iâ€™m continually surprised how often something good happens to me because of something I did to help a founder ten years ago.</p>

<p>One of the best ways to build a network is to develop a reputation for really taking care of the people who work with you. Be overly generous with sharing the upside; it will come back to you 10x. Also, learn how to evaluate what people are great at, and put them in those roles. (This is the most important thing I have learned about management, and I havenâ€™t read much about it.) You want to have a reputation for pushing people hard enough that they accomplish more than they thought they could, but not so hard they burn out.</p>

<p>Everyone is better at some things than others. Define yourself by your strengths, not your weaknesses. Acknowledge your weaknesses and figure out how to work around them, but donâ€™t let them stop you from doing what you want to do. â€œI canâ€™t do X because Iâ€™m not good at Yâ€ is something I hear from entrepreneurs surprisingly often, and almost always reflects a lack of creativity. The best way to make up for your weaknesses is to hire complementary team members instead of just hiring people who are good at the same things you are.</p>

<p>A particularly valuable part of building a network is to get good at discovering undiscovered talent. Quickly spotting intelligence, drive, and creativity gets much easier with practice. The easiest way to learn is just to meet a lot of people, and keep track of who goes on to impress you and who doesnâ€™t. Remember that you are mostly looking for rate of improvement, and donâ€™t overvalue experience or current accomplishment.</p>

<p>A special case of developing a network is finding someone eminent to take a bet on you, ideally early in your career. The best way to do this, no surprise, is to go out of your way to be helpful. (And remember that you have to pay this forward at some point later!)</p>

<p>Most people are primarily externally driven; they do what they do because they want to impress other people. This is bad for many reasons, but here are two important ones.</p>

<p>First, you will work on consensus ideas and on consensus career tracks.  You will care a lotâ€”much more than you realizeâ€”if other people think youâ€™re doing the right thing. This will probably prevent you from doing truly interesting work, and even if you do, someone else would have done it anyway.</p>

<p>Second, you will usually get risk calculations wrong. Youâ€™ll be very focused on keeping up with other people and not falling behind in competitive games, even in the short term.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>The most successful people I know are primarily internally driven; they do what they do to impress themselves and because they feel compelled to make something happen in the world. After youâ€™ve made enough money to buy whatever you want and gotten enough social status that it stops being fun to get more, this is the only force I know of that will continue to drive you to higher levels of performance.</p>

<p>This is why the question of a personâ€™s motivation is so important. Itâ€™s the first thing I try to understand about someone. The right motivations are hard to define a set of rules for, but you know it when you see it.</p>

<p>Jessica Livingston and Paul Graham are my benchmarks for this. YC was widely mocked for the first few years, and almost no one thought it would be a big success when they first started. But they thought it would be great for the world if it worked, and they love helping people, and they were convinced their new model was better than the existing model.</p>

<p>Eventually, you will define your success by performing excellent work in areas that are important to you. The sooner you can start off in that direction, the further you will be able to go. It is hard to be wildly successful at anything you arenâ€™t obsessed with.</p>
