<p><em>Warren Buffett took an interview in 2012 April, to explain respectively, about how he was thinking about his life at age 25  . He talked about taking a train to Manhattan every morning and working for Ben Graham, retirement plan because he believed that he could rely on the investment income and how he started his first investment partnership. As a big fan boy of Warren Buffett, I naturally want to replicate. I have been working for people who I admire without negotiating salary. At about the age of 27 and 2/3, I also thought that I just rely on investment income and retire as well. One thing missing writing a memo regarding age 25, so I have been planning to do the same and write an essay about mine. Butâ€¦ I procrastinated and have not written any single words until three years later. Therefore, unfortunately this title have to be â€œwhen I was 28, just 3 years lateâ€</em></p>

<p>Dear Richard,
Itâ€™s been a while I havenâ€™t had a conversation with you. I would say I have been busy, but I feel like the busier I am, the more I should spend more time having more introspective conversation with myself. It is really easy to be caught up by nitty gritty in life while forgetting about the bigger mission.</p>

<p>When faced a challenge or an issue, I always find that having a long-term view is more productive compares to a short-term prospect. One of the pitfalls I frequently run into is that I focused too much on the short term. And sometimes it can be really detrimental that I forgot about all the long-term significance of many decisions.</p>

<p>Another thing I find myself doing constantly is focusing too much on the things I have been done wrong.  Regurgitating mistakes is a valuable action. But sometimes I find myself putting them under my microscope too much. With such an obsession, I indulge myself in this passive sentiment and really canâ€™t let go. It reminds me an idea Warren Buffett once explain that we shouldnâ€™t dwell on the regrets, because you really canâ€™t go back and fix anything. We live our life forward and you should think about what you can do in the future.</p>

<p>I genuinely believe that I have a social responsibility to contribute to society rather than just sleepwalk through life. I have the privilege to be in a situation that I donâ€™t need to have an immediate obligation and need to worry about or to worry about living paycheck by paycheck. Even if your power is initially very limited, you can still start walking on this path by being having agreeable personality. Then after your impact gets bigger you can start to offer positive impact to others</p>

<p>Having of an goal of making impact to the world (even just a little bit) can appear to be blue sky thinking on the surface. And it does look like that. Iâ€™ve been talking a great deal about space travel and genetic engineering, solving problems of limited limited resources on earth and the longevity problems of human race. These ideas are so out of touch of ordinary people and are even more ridiculous for a youngster like me. I clearly cannot solve these problems right now, they are bottomless sink for capital, energy, and time.  I will be out of mind believing I can tackle these problems now.</p>

<p>My idea is to break it down into infinitesimal steps, so they become actionable. When in doubt, always break them down into tiny goals that sometimes seems hilarious easy. Very long essay to read? Read the first paragraph. Very lengthy PowerPoint slide to make? Finish the cover. Donâ€™t want to work out? Lift this dumbbell just for once. Usually the momentum will build up and everything will start moving. If not, take a short break and try again.</p>

<p>Back to the space travel. if I want to create a space travel company now it is obviously laughable. Within its first 10 years, SpaceX spend about 1 billion from 2002 to 2012  . Thatâ€™s a lot of money if you do know. Even Elon Musk didnâ€™t have that kind of money laying around to squander. He personally invested 100 million and raise the remaining capital on the go. Still 100 million is, not the kind of money siting in the bank account for overwhelming majority of people. Fortunately, Elon Musk wasnâ€™t born with that money either, he had to earn those money somewhere.</p>

<p>To further break under 100 million you probably need to focus on getting 10 million first. With 10 million, you can invest, build your company, or any other activity that can potential get them into 100 million. You need money to make money. Edgar Bronfman said that: â€œTo turn $100 into $110 is work. To turn 100 million into $110 million is inevitable.â€</p>

<p>10 million is still to much, so what I need to do? To further break it down into a 1 million goal. Granted, 1 million is still not the kind of money to joke about, so I have to further break it down into a 100k goal. At this point, this goal is a much more reasonable goal to hit.</p>

<p>A lot of worrying comes from uncertainty, I believe. As one of my friend pointed out for me, if there is an absolute certainty that Iâ€™m in deep trouble, I will not hesitate about the situation because I know that I need to face whatever it throw at me, period. When you have 2 choices, you have 2 options, but when you have only 1 choice, you have no option but to take it. If there is a certain disaster or an imminent challenge, I have no choice but to work on it. It makes a little sense to sit there and worry, instead of poking around here and there just to see if anything works and start with the least resistance.</p>

<p>Self-doubting is a self-fulfilling prophecy. A person without fully invested motivations is not going to take full advantage of its potential. And that translates to a more mediocre result. Thus, eventually your doubt is always true, no matter what your potential actually is.</p>

<p>What if after serious attempt, the result is not the way you hoped? Of course, way too many times that things are not going to work out the way that you want it to be or intended to be.

<p>It probably worth explaining a little bit more on my fears. Why am I worried. I think one of the sources of the sentiment is the fear of missing out. What if I take the safe options that is going to produce a predictable result? What if I take a bet, and I end up in a situation that can be worse than playing it safe?</p>

<p>Most of my worries can be summarized into a fear of failing, I assume. Many times I consider myself seriously doomed, yet I outlasted each of my crises. Ending up in a crisis is not the end of the day. The more crises I encounter, the less scary the next one become. I made it worked last time, Iâ€™m sure I can make it work this time.</p>

<p>The fear of rejection is one thing that stop you from asking for anything that can be important to you.  As such I might give up something that would have been extremely important. Such a line of reason is clearly irrational. Even though, now come to think about it, have I ever regretted anything that Iâ€™ve done ambitiously? No, I think I spent too much time regretting thing I havenâ€™t done (thatâ€™s a revelation that sudden dawn upon me). it is the error of omission rather than commission that bug me the most. I think itâ€™s part of human nature to fear failure to a point to not do anything at all although it equates a guaranteed failure.</p>

<p>The fear of missing out, or peer pressure assume, can be another factor that contributes to some of the fear. Itâ€™s tempting to compare others progress be a career, monetary gain, some other materialistic goals, or some sort of title. However, everyone lives their life very different, it is very important to work on what matters the most</p>

<p>Speaking the circle of friends, it seems a good idea to associate yourself with like-minded and energetic people, with quality that you admire. Good quality is contagious. It appears that the average of your best friends defines who you are likely to be. It is lonely to go all by yourself. The support system from friends is amazing. I think Warren Buffett advice of working for someone who you admire is a very strong strategy.</p>

<p>What is your favorite work you want to do? It seems like a simultaneously the easiest and the hardest question to answer. It seems easy, because it should come naturally to you, or it appears. It is virtually unseen if someone struggle to name his/her favorite food or color. However, it also seems like a hard question because a large portion of people is taking jobs that they donâ€™t necessarily like. Some yet even struggle to find an answer to what is their favorite job. Most likely the job they are working on was something that just happen to show up for them to take.</p>

<p>Talking about obsession, Bill Gates said : â€œThe thing you do obsessively between age 13 and 18, thatâ€™s the thing you have the most chance of being world-class at.â€ For the record, the time frame encompass the entirety of the middle school. The first thing that comes to mind is making stuff. I make a lot of tiny gimmicks and gadgets.

<p>An Interesting what if scenario is that I also seriously considered computer science while choosing college major. It is also a field that is totally different from finance. Thus, if I start a company, I might choose to make a service web service company instead. I feel like nowadays almost everything can be outsourced and modularize. So, you can still make some web service company if you are a complete programing noob. For example, you can build online teaching company using 3rd party platform, although your options may be more limited. If you can code yourself, you have more option.</p>

<p>Speaking of programing, there are two things that pop up on top of my mind:</p>
<ol>
  <li>One thing I could have done this to double major which is to study business and computer science. Nevertheless, it is something in the past. It makes little sense to think about what I could do differently</li>
  <li>Learning to code today. Sam Altman said teaching yourself code in a month or two is possible. And you only need some basic skill to make the version 1 products. And after that, if the product does prove to be interesting, attracts attention, and starts to gain momentum, you can start to hire more seasoned programmers</li>

  <p>If you think about the difference between me and you in terms of how we live. We wear the same cloth basically. All right, SunTrust gives me mine. We all have a chance to drink the juice of god here. We all go to McDonald or, better yet, Dairy Queen. We live in a house thatâ€™s warm in the winter and cool in the summer. We watch the Nebraska and Texas A&amp;M on a big screen. You see it in the same way I see it. We do everythingâ€¦ our life ainâ€™t that different, you know. You will get decent medical care when something happens to and I will get decent medical care. The only thing we do differently is we travel differently: I ride around this little plane and I love it. That takes money. But if you leave that aside, other than travel, think about it, what can I do that you canâ€™t do? I get to work in a job that I love, but I always work in a job I love. I love it just as much when it was a big deal if I made a thousand bucks. I urge you to work in jobs you love.</p>

<p>One can argue that it can be a billionaire lie. But it could be true. I once over here a conference in which Minhong Yu, CEO of New Oriental, talked about the hassle of keeping expensive items such as a yacht, so he rented his friendsâ€™ whenever he needs.</p>

<p>I personally also get to know a few who are lucky in the conventional sense to be born in an incredibly wealth family. I donâ€™t see them to be exponentially happier compared to me. Happiness doesnâ€™t seem to scale very well with materialistic possession. In the book Thinking Fast and Slow, Daniel Kahneman quoted a research shows that the money matters only to a point. And beyond that, happiness wonâ€™t go with more income or possession. One thing to keep in mind that during year 2015-2019, the median household income in the US is $62.843. Thus the point of maximum satisfaction from higher income is just 19.35% or less higher than the national median number.</p>

  <p>The satiation level beyond which experienced well-being no longer increases was a household income of about $75,000 in high-cost areas (it could be less in areas where the cost of living is lower). The average increase of experienced well-being associated with incomes beyond that level was precisely zero.</p>

<p>This is an interesting concept to me. Iâ€™ve been awfully terrified and struggle regarding romantic relationships. I often wonder whether I am very eccentric to a point that I cannot easily get on well with the opposite sex. I feel like itâ€™s human nature to look forward to having a close emotional connection with someone. Love is an amazing thing that binds two strangers together.</p>
