Buffett: Itâ€™s hard to give advice to someone who might lose their job. My Dad went to work on August 13, 1931 to find out the bank where he worked and held all our money had closed. He had no job and no money and two kids. You want to be as prepared as you can and you just donâ€™t want to have debt. Medical problems cause a lot of the grief and lots of credit card debt. Credit cards are poison. If you make a dollar, only spend 95 cents, not $1.05. You should be ahead of the game all the time rather than behind as it is harder to work your way out of a hole. You want to play the game from strength, and you have to think ahead. People donâ€™t always want to hear advice when things are going well. People risked everything they had and needed for something they didnâ€™t have or need. Charlie once said, â€œThe problem isnâ€™t getting rich, itâ€™s staying sane.</p>
