I"˟<p>我观察了数以千计的创始人，并思考了很多关于如何赚取巨额财富或创造一些重要的东西的方法。 通常，人们刚开始的时候想要前者，然后后来开始追求后者。</p>

<p>I’ve observed thousands of founders and thought a lot about what it takes to make a huge amount of money or to create something important. Usually, people start off wanting the former and end up wanting the latter.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>这里有 13 个关于如何获得如此量级的成功的建议。 假如你已经有一定的基本成功条件（通过某种出身或努力）并愿意为进一步的成功而投入努力的时候，一切都会变得更容易。 [1] 但这里的大部分应该依然适用于任何人。</p>

<p>Here are 13 thoughts about how to achieve such outlier success. Everything here is easier to do once you’ve already reached a baseline degree of success (through privilege or effort) and want to put in the work to turn that into outlier success. [1] But much of it applies to anyone.</p>

<h2 id="1-对自己的持续复利-compound-yourself">1. 对自己的持续复利 Compound yourself</h2>

<p>持续复利是一种魔法。你应该想办法寻找这样的机会。 指数曲线是财富产生的关键。
Compounding is magic. Look for it everywhere. Exponential curves are the key to wealth generation.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>每年价值增长 50% 的中型企业在很短的时间内就会变得庞大。 世界上很少有企业拥有真正的网络效应和极高的可扩展性。 但是随着技术的发展，越来越多的人会这样做。 找到它们并创造它们是值得付出很多努力的。</p>

<p>A medium-sized business that grows 50% in value every year becomes huge in a very short amount of time. Few businesses in the world have true network effects and extreme scalability. But with technology, more and more will.  It’s worth a lot of effort to find them and create them.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>你也会想把自己成为一条指数曲线——你应该让你的生活遵循一条不断增长的向上和正确的轨迹。 选择具有复合效应的职业很重要——大多数职业的发展相当线性。</p>

<p>You also want to be an exponential curve yourself—you should aim for your life to follow an ever-increasing up-and-to-the-right trajectory. It’s important to move towards a career that has a compounding effect—most careers progress fairly linearly.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>你不希望从事的职业是两年工作经验的人可以和二十年工作经验的人在效率没有差别——你的学习增长率应该一直很高。 随着你的职业发展，你所做的每份付出都应该产生越来越多的结果。 获得这种杠杆的方式有很多，比如资金、科技、品牌、网络效应、管理团队等。</p>

<p>You don’t want to be in a career where people who have been doing it for two years can be as effective as people who have been doing it for twenty—your rate of learning should always be high. As your career progresses, each unit of work you do should generate more and more results. There are many ways to get this leverage, such as capital, technology, brand, network effects, and managing people.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>专注于如何将你认为是成功的东西增长10倍是很有用的——金钱、地位、对世界的影响等等。 我愿意在找到我的下一件机会之前花尽可能多的时间做准备。 但我一直希望这样的机会是那一类巨大的机会，如果成功，它将使我的职业生涯的其余部分看起来像一个脚注。</p>

<p>It’s useful to focus on adding another zero to whatever you define as your success metric—money, status, impact on the world, or whatever. I am willing to take as much time as needed between projects to find my next thing. But I always want it to be a project that, if successful, will make the rest of my career look like a footnote.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>大多数人都太投入寻找那些线性的机会。你可以选择放掉一些小机会，而专注于潜在的质变变化。</p>

<p>Most people get bogged down in linear opportunities. Be willing to let small opportunities go to focus on potential step changes.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>我认为商业中最大的竞争优势——无论是对公司还是个人的职业生涯——是长远的思考，对世界上不同的系统如何融合在一起这件事有广阔的视野。 复合增长的显着方面之一是最远的未来是最重要的。 在一个几乎没有人选择长远发展的世界里，市场会给那些这样做的人带来丰厚的回报。</p>

<p>I think the biggest competitive advantage in business—either for a company or for an individual’s career—is long-term thinking with a broad view of how different systems in the world are going to come together. One of the notable aspects of compound growth is that the furthest out years are the most important. In a world where almost no one takes a truly long-term view, the market richly rewards those who do.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>相信指数增长，要有耐心，并做好被惊讶的准备。</p>

<p>Trust the exponential, be patient, and be pleasantly surprised.</p>

<h2 id="2-几乎过于自信-have-almost-too-much-self-belief">2. 几乎过于自信 Have almost too much self-belief</h2>

<p>自信是非常强大的。 我认识的最成功的人几乎都相信自己到了一种妄想的地步 。</p>

<p>Self-belief is immensely powerful. The most successful people I know believe in themselves almost to the point of delusion.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>尽早培养这一点。 当你有足够数据来支持你的判断是正确的并且你可以做到始终如一地执行时，请更加相信自己。</p>

<p>Cultivate this early. As you get more data points that your judgment is good and you can consistently deliver results, trust yourself more.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>如果你不相信自己，就很难让自己对未来产生反主流的想法。 但这是最大创造价值的机会所在的地方。</p>

<p>If you don’t believe in yourself, it’s hard to let yourself have contrarian ideas about the future. But this is where most value gets created.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>我记得很多年前埃隆马斯克带我参观了 SpaceX 工厂。 他详细谈到了制造火箭的每个部分，但记忆中最深刻的是当他谈到向火星发射大型火箭时，他脸上绝对笃定的表情。 我离开时想“嗯，这就是有信念的人应该看起来的感觉。”</p>

<p>I remember when Elon Musk took me on a tour of the SpaceX factory many years ago. He talked in detail about manufacturing every part of the rocket, but the thing that sticks in memory was the look of absolute certainty on his face when he talked about sending large rockets to Mars. I left thinking “huh, so that’s the benchmark for what conviction looks like.”</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>管理自己的士气——以及团队的士气——是大多数努力中最大的挑战之一。 如果没有很多自信，这几乎是不可能的。 不幸的是，你越有野心，世界就越想把你拆毁。</p>

<p>Managing your own morale—and your team’s morale—is one of the greatest challenges of most endeavors. It’s almost impossible without a lot of self-belief. And unfortunately, the more ambitious you are, the more the world will try to tear you down.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>大多数非常成功的人在人们认为他们错了的时候，至少有一次对未来的看法是正确的。 如果不是这样，他们将面临更多的竞争。</p>

<p>Most highly successful people have been really right about the future at least once at a time when people thought they were wrong. If not, they would have faced much more competition.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>自信必须与自我意识相平衡。 我曾经讨厌任何形式的批评，并积极回避它。 现在我试着总是在假设它是真的的情况下听它们，然后决定我是否要采取行动。 寻求真理是困难的，而且往往是痛苦的，但它是区分自信满满和自欺欺人的关键。</p>

<p>Self-belief must be balanced with self-awareness. I used to hate criticism of any sort and actively avoided it. Now I try to always listen to it with the assumption that it’s true, and then decide if I want to act on it or not. Truth-seeking is hard and often painful, but it is what separates self-belief from self-delusion.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>这种平衡还可以帮助你避免给人一种造作和不接地气的印象。</p>

<p>This balance also helps you avoid coming across as entitled and out of touch.</p>

<h2 id="3-学会独立思考-learn-to-think-independently">3. 学会独立思考 Learn to think independently</h2>

<p>创业很难教，因为原创思维很难教。 学校不是为了教授这个而设立的——事实上，它通常会奖励相反的东西。 所以你必须自己去培养它。</p>

<p>Entrepreneurship is very difficult to teach because original thinking is very difficult to teach. School is not set up to teach this—in fact, it generally rewards the opposite. So you have to cultivate it on your own.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>从第一原则思考并尝试产生新想法很有趣，找到可以与之交流的人是在这方面做得更好的好方法。 下一步是找到简单、快速的方法在现实世界中测试这些想法。</p>

<p>Thinking from first principles and trying to generate new ideas is fun, and finding people to exchange them with is a great way to get better at this. The next step is to find easy, fast ways to test these ideas in the real world.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>“我会失败很多次，我会真正正确一次”是企业家的方式。 你必须给自己很多机会来获得好运。</p>

<p>“I will fail many times, and I will be really right once” is the entrepreneurs’ way. You have to give yourself a lot of chances to get lucky.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>你要学习的最有力的教训之一是，你可以弄清楚在似乎没有解决方案的情况下该怎么做。 你这样做的次数越多，你就越相信它。 勇气来自于学习你可以在被击倒后重新站起来。</p>

<p>One of the most powerful lessons to learn is that you can figure out what to do in situations that seem to have no solution. The more times you do this, the more you will believe it. Grit comes from learning you can get back up after you get knocked down.</p>

<h2 id="4-擅长销售-get-good-at-sales">4. 擅长“销售” Get good at “sales”</h2>

<p>仅有自信是不够的——你还必须能够说服其他人相信你的信仰。</p>

<p>Self-belief alone is not sufficient—you also have to be able to convince other people of what you believe.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>在某种程度上，所有高价值的职业都是销售工作。 你必须向客户、潜在员工、媒体、投资者等宣传你的计划。这需要鼓舞人心的愿景、强大的沟通技巧、一定程度的魅力和执行能力的证据。</p>

<p>All great careers, to some degree, become sales jobs. You have to evangelize your plans to customers, prospective employees, the press, investors, etc. This requires an inspiring vision, strong communication skills, some degree of charisma, and evidence of execution ability.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>善于沟通——尤其是书面沟通——是一项值得进行练习的自我投资。 对于清晰沟通，我的最佳建议是首先确保你的想法清晰，然后使用简单、简洁的语言。</p>

<p>Getting good at communication—particularly written communication—is an investment worth making. My best advice for communicating clearly is to first make sure your thinking is clear and then use plain, concise language.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>擅长销售的最好方法是真诚地相信你所销售的东西。 出售你真正相信的东西感觉很棒，而试图出售蛇油感觉很糟糕。</p>

<p>The best way to be good at sales is to genuinely believe in what you’re selling. Selling what you truly believe in feels great, and trying to sell snake oil feels awful.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>擅长销售就像提高任何其他技能一样——任何人都可以通过刻意练习变得更好。 但不知为何，或许是因为让人觉得恶心，所以很多人把它当作不可学习的东西。</p>

<p>Getting good at sales is like improving at any other skill—anyone can get better at it with deliberate practice. But for some reason, perhaps because it feels distasteful, many people treat it as something unlearnable.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>我的另一个重要销售技巧是在重要的时候亲自出现。 刚开始的时候，我总是愿意坐飞机到现场。 这通常是不必要的，但它三度为我带来了职业生涯的转折点，否则我的人生会完全不同。</p>

<p>My other big sales tip is to show up in person whenever it’s important. When I was first starting out, I was always willing to get on a plane. It was frequently unnecessary, but three times it led to career-making turning points for me that otherwise would have gone the other way.</p>

<h2 id="5-让冒险变得容易-make-it-easy-to-take-risks">5. 让冒险变得容易 Make it easy to take risks</h2>

<p>大多数人高估风险而低估回报。 冒险很重要，因为不可能一直都是对的——你必须尝试很多事情，并随着你了解更多而迅速适应。</p>

<p>Most people overestimate risk and underestimate reward. Taking risks is important because it’s impossible to be right all the time—you have to try many things and adapt quickly as you learn more.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>在职业生涯的早期冒险通常更容易； 你没有什么可失去的，你可能会得到很多。 一旦你已经达到了你的可以满足基本生活需求的地步，你应该试着让冒险变得容易。 寻找你可以做的小赌注，如果你错了，你会输掉 1 倍，但如果可行，你可以增长100 倍。 然后在那个方向下更大的赌注。</p>

<p>It’s often easier to take risks early in your career; you don’t have much to lose, and you potentially have a lot to gain. Once you’ve gotten yourself to a point where you have your basic obligations covered you should try to make it easy to take risks. Look for small bets you can make where you lose 1x if you’re wrong but make 100x if it works. Then make a bigger bet in that direction.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>不过，不要花太多时间去存钱。 在 YC，我们经常注意到在谷歌或 Facebook 工作了很多时间的创始人的问题。 当人们习惯了舒适的生活、可预测的工作以及无论做什么都能取得成功的声誉时，就很难将其抛在脑后（人们有一种不可思议的能力，可以始终将自己的生活开销与明年的薪水相匹配）。 即使他们真的离开了，回来的诱惑也很大。 将短期收益和便利置于长期实现之上是很容易和服从人性的。</p>

<p>Don’t save up for too long, though. At YC, we’ve often noticed a problem with founders that have spent a lot of time working at Google or Facebook. When people get used to a comfortable life, a predictable job, and a reputation of succeeding at whatever they do, it gets very hard to leave that behind (and people have an incredible ability to always match their lifestyle to next year’s salary). Even if they do leave, the temptation to return is great. It’s easy—and human nature—to prioritize short-term gain and convenience over long-term fulfillment.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>但是，当你不需要反复月光的时候，你可以按照自己的直觉，花时间在可能会变得非常有趣的事情上。 尽可能长时间地保持低开销和灵活的生活是一种有效的方法，但显然需要权衡取舍。</p>

<p>But when you aren’t on the treadmill, you can follow your hunches and spend time on things that might turn out to be really interesting. Keeping your life cheap and flexible for as long as you can is a powerful way to do this, but obviously comes with tradeoffs.</p>

<h2 id="6-聚焦-focus">6. 聚焦 Focus</h2>

<p>专注是工作的力量乘数（译者注：力量乘数(Force multiplication) 是军事战术名词，用以评估一个军事单位加上非人力因素后能获得或减少的战斗力）。</p>

<p>Focus is a force multiplier on work.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>几乎我见过的每个人都会因为花更多时间思考应该关注什么而得到很好的结果。 做正确的事比工作几个小时重要得多。 大多数人把大部分时间浪费在无关紧要的事情上。</p>

<p>Almost everyone I’ve ever met would be well-served by spending more time thinking about what to focus on. It is much more important to work on the right thing than it is to work many hours. Most people waste most of their time on stuff that doesn’t matter.</p>

<h2 id="7-努力工作-work-hard">7. 努力工作 Work hard</h2>

<p>通过聪明或努力工作，你可以达到你所在领域的前10%左右，这已经是一项了不起的成就。 但要达到前1%，你需要两者的组合——你将与其他非常有才华的人竞争，他们会有很好的想法并愿意做很多工作。</p>

<p>You can get to about the 90th percentile in your field by working either smart or hard, which is still a great accomplishment. But getting to the 99th percentile requires both—you will be competing with other very talented people who will have great ideas and be willing to work a lot.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>极端的人得到极端的结果。 大量工作伴随着巨大的生活牺牲，决定不这样做是完全合理的。但这样的做法有很多优点。 在大多数情况下，前进的能量不断累计，一个成功会带来下一个成功。</p>

<p>Extreme people get extreme results. Working a lot comes with huge life trade-offs, and it’s perfectly rational to decide not to do it. But it has a lot of advantages. As in most cases, momentum compounds, and success begets success.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>而且这通常很有趣。 生活中最大的乐趣之一就是找到你的目标，在目标上表现出色，并发现你在影响除了你自己以外的事物。 一位 YC 创始人最近表示，他在离开一家大公司并努力实现最大可能的影响后变得更加快乐和充实，这让他感到非常惊讶。 我们应该庆祝为此付出的努力。</p>

<p>And it’s often really fun. One of the great joys in life is finding your purpose, excelling at it, and discovering that your impact matters to something larger than yourself. A YC founder recently expressed great surprise about how much happier and more fulfilled he was after leaving his job at a big company and working towards his maximum possible impact. Working hard at that should be celebrated.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>我并不完全清楚为什么在美国某些地方努力工作会变成一件坏事，但在世界其他地区肯定不是这样——美国以外的企业家表现出的精力和动力很快会被大家效仿。</p>

<p>It’s not entirely clear to me why working hard has become a Bad Thing in certain parts of the US, but this is certainly not the case in other parts of the world—the amount of energy and drive exhibited by entrepreneurs outside of the US is quickly becoming the new benchmark.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>你必须弄清楚如何努力工作而不会筋疲力尽。 人们为此找到了自己的策略，但几乎总是有效的策略是找到你喜欢的工作和你喜欢花很多时间在一起的人一起努力。</p>

<p>You have to figure out how to work hard without burning out. People find their own strategies for this, but one that almost always works is to find work you like doing with people you enjoy spending a lot of time with.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>我认为那些假装你可以在大部分时间（在你生命中的某些时期）不工作的情况下获得超级成功的人是在做坏事。 事实上，持续工作似乎是长期成功的最大预测因素之一。</p>

<p>I think people who pretend you can be super successful professionally without working most of the time (for some period of your life) are doing a disservice. In fact, work stamina seems to be one of the biggest predictors of long-term success.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>还有一个关于努力工作的想法：在你职业生涯的开始就去大胆动手。 努力工作会像利息一样复合，你越早做，你就有更多的时间来获得回报。 当你没有太多别的顾虑时，也更容易努力工作，这种情况经常发生在你年轻的时候，虽然并非总是如此。</p>

<p>One more thought about working hard: do it at the beginning of your career. Hard work compounds like interest, and the earlier you do it, the more time you have for the benefits to pay off. It’s also easier to work hard when you have fewer other responsibilities, which is frequently but not always the case when you’re young.</p>

<h2 id="8-大胆-be-bold">8. 大胆 Be bold</h2>

<p>我相信一个大胆的创业项目比简单的创业项目更容易。 人们想成为令人兴奋的事情的一部分，并觉得他们的工作很重要。</p>

<p>I believe that it’s easier to do a hard startup than an easy startup. People want to be part of something exciting and feel that their work matters.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>如果你在一个重要问题上取得了进展，你会不断遇到想要帮助你的人。 让自己变得更有野心，不要害怕去做你真正想做的事情。</p>

<p>If you are making progress on an important problem, you will have a constant tailwind of people wanting to help you. Let yourself grow more ambitious, and don’t be afraid to work on what you really want to work on.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>如果其他人都在抢风口，而你想创办一家基因编辑公司，那就去做吧，不要再猜测了。</p>

<p>If everyone else is starting meme companies, and you want to start a gene-editing company, then do that and don’t second guess it.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>跟随你的好奇心。 对你来说令人兴奋的事情，对其他人来说往往也会令人兴奋。</p>

<p>Follow your curiosity. Things that seem exciting to you will often seem exciting to other people too.</p>

<h2 id="9-任性-be-willful">9. 任性 Be willful</h2>

<p>一个情况是，世界是相当程度的可以被改变的——大多数人甚至不尝试，只是接受事情就是这样。</p>

<p>A big secret is that you can bend the world to your will a surprising percentage of the time—most people don’t even try, and just accept that things are the way that they are.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>人们拥有使事情发生的巨大能力。自我怀疑、过早放弃以及没有足够努力地推动这些因素使大多数人无法达到他们的潜力。
People have an enormous capacity to make things happen. A combination of self-doubt, giving up too early, and not pushing hard enough prevents most people from ever reaching anywhere near their potential.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>去争取你想要的。你通常不会得到它，而且拒绝通常会很痛苦。但是在那些少有的成功情况下，成功的效果出奇的好。</p>

<p>Ask for what you want. You usually won’t get it, and often the rejection will be painful. But when this works, it works surprisingly well.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>几乎总是，那些说“我将继续前进，直到成功，无论挑战是什么，我都会解决它们”的人，并且是不只是说说而已的，最终会成功。他们坚持足够长的时间，让自己有机会让运气如愿以偿。</p>

<p>Almost always, the people who say “I am going to keep going until this works, and no matter what the challenges are I’m going to figure them out”, and mean it, go on to succeed. They are persistent long enough to give themselves a chance for luck to go their way.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>Airbnb是我的基准。关于他们的一些历史我不建议读者去尝试复制（在小孩子用的棒球卡的九槽三环活页夹中保留已刷满的信用卡，每顿饭吃一元店麦片，与现有的竞争者一场又一场的斡旋，等等），但他们设法生存了足够长的时间，让运气如愿以偿。</p>

<p>Airbnb is my benchmark for this. There are so many stories they tell that I wouldn’t recommend trying to reproduce (keeping maxed-out credit cards in those nine-slot three-ring binder pages kids use for baseball cards, eating dollar store cereal for every meal, battle after battle with powerful entrenched interest, and on and on) but they managed to survive long enough for luck to go their way.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>要变得任性，就必须保持乐观——还好这是一种可以通过练习得到改善的性格特征。我从来没有遇到过一个非常成功的悲观主义者。</p>

<p>To be willful, you have to be optimistic—hopefully this is a personality trait that can be improved with practice. I have never met a very successful pessimistic person.</p>

<h2 id="10-变得难以被竞争-be-hard-to-compete-with">10. 变得难以被竞争 Be hard to compete with</h2>

<p>大多数人都明白，如果公司难以与之竞争，它们就会更有价值。 这很重要，而且显然是正确的。</p>

<p>Most people understand that companies are more valuable if they are difficult to compete with. This is important, and obviously true</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>但这也适用于你作为个人。 如果你所做的事情可以由其他人完成，那么最终会有人去这么做，而且ta可能会以比你更低的成本去完成这件事。</p>

<p>But this holds true for you as an individual as well. If what you do can be done by someone else, it eventually will be, and for less money.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>变得难以被竞争的最好方法是建立影响力。 例如，你可以通过人际关系、建立强大的个人品牌或擅长多个不同领域的交叉点来做到这一点。 还有很多其他的策略，但你必须想出一些方法来做到这一点。</p>

<p>The best way to become difficult to compete with is to build up leverage. For example, you can do it with personal relationships, by building a strong personal brand, or by getting good at the intersection of multiple different fields. There are many other strategies, but you have to figure out some way to do it.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>大多数人都会复制他们的圈子里大多数人所做的事情。 这种模仿行为通常是一个错误——如果你在做其他人都在做的事情，你就不会很难被竞争。</p>

<p>Most people do whatever most people they hang out with do. This mimetic behavior is usually a mistake—if you’re doing the same thing everyone else is doing, you will not be hard to compete with.</p>

<h2 id="11-建立人脉-build-a-network">11. 建立人脉 Build a network</h2>

<p>伟大的工作需要团队。 建立一个有才华的人的人脉网络——有时密切，有时松散——是伟大职业生涯的重要组成部分。 你所认识的真正有才华的人的网络规模大小通常会决定你可以完成的工作大小。</p>

<p>Great work requires teams. Developing a network of talented people to work with—sometimes closely, sometimes loosely—is an essential part of a great career. The size of the network of really talented people you know often becomes the limiter for what you can accomplish.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>建立人脉的有效方法是尽可能多地帮助人们。 在很长一段时间内，这样做是我获得大部分最佳职业机会和四项最佳投资中的三项的原因。 由于十年前我为帮助一位创始人所做的事情，我经常会发生一些好事，这让我不断感到惊讶。</p>

<p>An effective way to build a network is to help people as much as you can. Doing this, over a long period of time, is what lead to most of my best career opportunities and three of my four best investments. I’m continually surprised how often something good happens to me because of something I did to help a founder ten years ago.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>建立人脉的最佳方式之一是建立真正在意你的并与你一起工作的人的声誉。 过于慷慨地分享你得到的；别人会以 10 倍的速度返回给你。 此外，学习如何评估人们擅长的领域，并让他们担任这些角色。（这是我在管理方面学到的最重要的东西，而我其实没怎么读过管理学书籍。）你想要有一个这样的声誉：推动他们足够努力地完成比他们想象的更多的事情，但不至于过度努力而精疲力尽。</p>

<p>One of the best ways to build a network is to develop a reputation for really taking care of the people who work with you. Be overly generous with sharing the upside; it will come back to you 10x. Also, learn how to evaluate what people are great at, and put them in those roles. (This is the most important thing I have learned about management, and I haven’t read much about it.) You want to have a reputation for pushing people hard enough that they accomplish more than they thought they could, but not so hard they burn out.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>每个人在某些事情上都比其他事情做得更好。 用你的长处来定义自己，而不是你的弱点。 承认你的弱点并弄清楚如何解决它们，但不要让它们阻止你做你想做的事。 “我不能做 X 因为我不擅长 Y”是我经常从企业家那里听到的令人惊讶的话，而且几乎总是反映出缺乏创造力。 弥补你的弱点的最好方法是雇佣互补的团队成员，而不是仅仅雇佣那些擅长与你相同的人。</p>

<p>Everyone is better at some things than others. Define yourself by your strengths, not your weaknesses. Acknowledge your weaknesses and figure out how to work around them, but don’t let them stop you from doing what you want to do. “I can’t do X because I’m not good at Y” is something I hear from entrepreneurs surprisingly often, and almost always reflects a lack of creativity. The best way to make up for your weaknesses is to hire complementary team members instead of just hiring people who are good at the same things you are.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>建立网络的一个特别有价值的部分是善于发现未被发现的人才。 通过练习，快速发现聪明、有驱动力和有创造力的人会变得更加容易。 最简单的学习方法就是结识很多人，并跟踪谁继续给你留下深刻印象，谁没有。 请记住，你主要是在寻找进步的速度，并且不要高估经验或当前的成就。</p>

<p>A particularly valuable part of building a network is to get good at discovering undiscovered talent. Quickly spotting intelligence, drive, and creativity gets much easier with practice. The easiest way to learn is just to meet a lot of people, and keep track of who goes on to impress you and who doesn’t. Remember that you are mostly looking for rate of improvement, and don’t overvalue experience or current accomplishment.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>当我遇到一个新人时，我总是会问自己“这个人是精力超群的人吗？” 对于寻找可能完成伟大事情的人来说，这是一个很好的启发式方法。</p>

<p>I try to always ask myself when I meet someone new “is this person a force of nature?” It’s a pretty good heuristic for finding people who are likely to accomplish great things.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>建立人脉的一个特例是找到一个杰出的人来对你下注，最好是在你职业生涯的早期。 毫不奇怪，做到这一点的最好方法就是竭尽全力提供帮助。 （请记住，你必须在以后的某个时间学会把这种善意传递下去！）</p>

<p>A special case of developing a network is finding someone eminent to take a bet on you, ideally early in your career. The best way to do this, no surprise, is to go out of your way to be helpful. (And remember that you have to pay this forward at some point later!)</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>最后，请记住与支持你的抱负的积极朋友们多花时间。</p>

<p>Finally, remember to spend your time with positive people who support your ambitions.</p>

<h2 id="12-你通过拥有东西变得富有-you-get-rich-by-owning-things">12. 你通过拥有东西变得富有 You get rich by owning things</h2>

<p>我小时候对于财富最大的误解是人们靠高薪致富。 尽管有一些例外——例如艺人——在福布斯榜单的历史上，几乎没有人依靠工资而上榜。</p>

<p>The biggest economic misunderstanding of my childhood was that people got rich from high salaries. Though there are some exceptions—entertainers for example —almost no one in the history of the Forbes list has gotten there with a salary.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>通过拥有价值迅速增加的东西，你会真正变得富有。</p>

<p>You get truly rich by owning things that increase rapidly in value.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>这可以是企业、房地产、自然资源、知识产权或其他类似事物的一部分。 但不知何故，财富的增长需要是拥有某样东西的所有权的一部分，而不是仅仅依靠贩卖你自己的时间。 时间只能线性缩放。</p>

<p>This can be a piece of a business, real estate, natural resource, intellectual property, or other similar things. But somehow or other, you need to own equity in something, instead of just selling your time. Time only scales linearly.</p>

<p>让事物快速增值的最佳方法是大规模复制人们想要的东西。</p>

<p>The best way to make things that increase rapidly in value is by making things people want at scale.</p>

<h2 id="13-拥有内部驱动力-be-internally-driven">13. 拥有内部驱动力 Be internally driven</h2>

<p>大多数人主要是外部驱动的； 他们做他们所做的事是因为他们想给别人留下深刻印象。 这很糟糕，原因有很多，但这里有两个重要的原因。</p>

<p>Most people are primarily externally driven; they do what they do because they want to impress other people. This is bad for many reasons, but here are two important ones.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>首先，你将做那些大众的达成共识的想法和从事大众达成共识的职业规划。 你会非常关心——比你意识到的要多得多——如果其他人认为你在做正确的事。 这可能会阻止你做真正有趣的工作，而且即使你在做有趣的事情，其他人可能都已经做的很好了。</p>

<p>First, you will work on consensus ideas and on consensus career tracks.  You will care a lot—much more than you realize—if other people think you’re doing the right thing. This will probably prevent you from doing truly interesting work, and even if you do, someone else would have done it anyway.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>其次，你通常会错误地计算风险。 即使在短期内，你也会非常专注于跟上其他人的步伐，并且不会在竞技游戏中落后。</p>

<p>Second, you will usually get risk calculations wrong. You’ll be very focused on keeping up with other people and not falling behind in competitive games, even in the short term.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>聪明人似乎特别容易受到这种外部驱动的行为的影响。 意识到它会有所帮助，但对你的帮助只有一点点——你可能必须非常努力地工作才能不落入模仿陷阱。</p>

<p>Smart people seem to be especially at risk of such externally-driven behavior. Being aware of it helps, but only a little—you will likely have to work super-hard to not fall in the mimetic trap.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>我认识的最成功的人主要是内部驱动的。 他们做他们所做的事情是为了给自己留下深刻印象，因为他们觉得有必要让世界上发生一些事情。 在你赚到足够的钱来购买你想要的任何东西并获得足够的社会地位之后，获得更多就不再有趣了，这是我所知道的唯一一种力量，它将继续推动你达到更高的水平。</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>The most successful people I know are primarily internally driven; they do what they do to impress themselves and because they feel compelled to make something happen in the world. After you’ve made enough money to buy whatever you want and gotten enough social status that it stops being fun to get more, this is the only force I know of that will continue to drive you to higher levels of performance.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>这就是为什么一个人的动机问题是如此重要的原因。 这是我试图了解某人的第一件事。 识别正确的动机很难定义一套规则，但时当你看到它时你就知道如何辨别。</p>

<p>This is why the question of a person’s motivation is so important. It’s the first thing I try to understand about someone. The right motivations are hard to define a set of rules for, but you know it when you see it.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>杰西卡·利文斯顿和保罗·格雷厄姆是我的参考。 YC 在最初几年受到了广泛的嘲笑，刚开始的时候几乎没有人认为它会取得巨大的成功。 但他们认为，如果它成功了，对世界来说会很棒，他们喜欢帮助别人，他们相信他们的新模式比现有模式更好。</p>

<p>Jessica Livingston and Paul Graham are my benchmarks for this. YC was widely mocked for the first few years, and almost no one thought it would be a big success when they first started. But they thought it would be great for the world if it worked, and they love helping people, and they were convinced their new model was better than the existing model.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>最终，你将通过在对你来说很重要的领域中表现出色来定义你的成功。 你越早朝着那个方向开始，你就能走得越远。 你在你并不痴迷的其他任何事情上都很难取得巨大成功。</p>

<p>Eventually, you will define your success by performing excellent work in areas that are important to you. The sooner you can start off in that direction, the further you will be able to go. It is hard to be wildly successful at anything you aren’t obsessed with.</p>

<p>[1] 我在 HN 上写的评论回复：</p>

<p>[1] A comment response I wrote on HN:</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>我对基本收入感到兴奋的最大原因之一是它将鼓励更多的人去承担风险，从而释放出人类的潜力。</p>

<p>One of the biggest reasons I’m excited about basic income is the amount of human potential it will unleash by freeing more people to take risks.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>否则在那之前，如果你不是天生幸运的人，你必须先努力积累上一段时间，然后才能进行勇敢尝试。 如果你出生在极端贫困的环境，那么这非常困难:(</p>

<p>Until then, if you aren’t born lucky, you have to claw your way up for awhile before you can take big swings. If you are born in extreme poverty, then this is super difficult :(</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>机会分布如此不均，显然是一种令人难以置信的耻辱和浪费。 但我目睹了足够多的人，出身在对他们不利的环境，然后继续取得令人难以置信的成功，因此这也是有可能的。</p>

<p>It is obviously an incredible shame and waste that opportunity is so unevenly distributed. But I’ve witnessed enough people be born with the deck stacked badly against them and go on to incredible success to know it’s possible.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>我深深地意识到，如果我不是生来非常幸运，我将不会是现在的我。</p>

<p>I am deeply aware of the fact that I personally would not be where I am if I weren’t born incredibly lucky.</p>
