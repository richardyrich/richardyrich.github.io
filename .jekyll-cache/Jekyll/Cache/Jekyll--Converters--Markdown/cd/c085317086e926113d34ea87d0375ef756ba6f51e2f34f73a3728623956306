  <p>We are thus led to put forward for most of our readers what may appear to be an oversimplified 50â€“ 50 formula. Under this plan the guiding rule is to maintain as nearly as practicable an equal division between bond and stock holdings. When changes in the market level have raised the common-stock component to, say, 55%, the balance would be restored by a sale of one-eleventh of the stock portfolio and the transfer of the proceeds to bonds. Conversely, a fall in the common-stock proportion to 45% would call for the use of one-eleventh of the bond fund to buy additional equities.</p>

  <p>The power of interest rates had the effect of pushing up equities as well, though other things that we will get to pushed additionally. And so hereâ€™s what equities did in that same 17 years: If youâ€™d invested $1 million in the Dow on Nov. 16, 1981, and reinvested all dividends, youâ€™d have had $19,720,112 on Dec. 31, 1998. And your annual return would have been 19%.
The increase in equity values since 1981 beats anything you can find in history. This increase even surpasses what you would have realized if youâ€™d bought stocks in 1932, at their Depression bottomâ€“on its lowest day, July 8, 1932, the Dow closed at 41.22â€“and held them for 17 years.</p>

  <p>As a matter of course, however, he consulted his father and Ben Graham. To his surprise, both said, â€œMaybe you should wait a few years.â€ Grahamâ€”as alwaysâ€”thought the market was too high. Howard, pessimistic, favored mining stocks and gold stocks and other investments designed to protect against inflation. He didnâ€™t think any other kind of business would be a good investment, and he worried about his sonâ€™s future.
â€¦
â€œIt was absolutely the reverse effect of what you saw in other times, when the market was staggeringly overvalued. I had looked at companies. I just couldnâ€™t see why you wouldnâ€™t want to own them. It was on a micro level, not an assessment of the growth of the economy or anything like that, and I was working with micro money. But it just seemed to me that it was crazy not to own them. On the other hand, hereâ€™s Ben, with his two hundred IQ, telling me to wait. And my dad, who, if he told me to walk out a window, I would have done it.â€ To make this decision to defy the advice of his two great authoritiesâ€”his father and Ben Grahamâ€”was an enormous step for Warren. It required him to consider the possibility that his judgment might be superior to theirs. Yet he was certain he was right. He might have walked out a window if his father told him toâ€”but not if it meant leaving a Moodyâ€™s Manual full of cheap stocks behind.</p>
