<p>“我今年19岁，我想计划未来，我该怎么办？”</p>

<p>“I’m an ambitious 19 year old, what should I do?”</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>我经常被问到这个问题，我现在有很多关于如何做准备的案例可以参考，所以我想我会分享我的回答。</p>

<p>I get asked this question fairly often, and I now have a lot of data on what works, so I thought I’d share my response.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>通常，人们会在上大学（并且通常在他们这样做的同时会做一些他们自己的业余项目）、加入公司或自己创业之间做出决定。  [1] [2]</p>

<p>Usually, people are deciding between going to college (and usually working on side projects while they do so), joining a company, or starting their own startup. [1] [2]</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>实际的事实是，这些都可以是正确的答案，你应该根据每个选项的具体情况做出决定。 关键是你想做的事情最有可能让你走上伟大的道路。</p>

<p>The secret is that any of these can be right answer, and you should make your decision based on the specific circumstances of each option.  The critical point is that you want to do the thing that is most likely to get you on a path to do something great.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>无论你最后选择了什么方向，你都尝试做点什么东西并且和那些聪明的人相处。 “东西”可以是很多不同的东西——学校课程要求以外的开源项目、创业公司、你所工作的公司的新销售流程——但是，很明显，和你的朋友坐在一起讨论你们应该如何真正建立一个网站不算。</p>

<p>No matter what you choose, build stuff and be around smart people.  “Stuff” can be a lot of different things—open source projects outside of class, a startup, a new sales process at a company you work at—but, obviously, sitting around talking with your friends about how you guys really should build a website together does not count.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>最优秀的人似乎总是在做点什么东西并与聪明的人在一起，所以如果你必须在几个选项之间做出决定，这可能是一个很好的筛选标准。</p>

<p>The best people always seem to be building stuff and hanging around smart people, so if you have to decide between several options, this may be a good filter.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>做一些有益的事情会让你走上一条好事会不断发生的道路。 （事实上，这种影响是如此强烈，以至于你这个时候有被卷入太多有趣的事情并没有专注于你真正想做的事情的危险。）</p>

<p>Working on something good will pull you along a path where good things keep happening to you.  (In fact, this effect is so strong that there’s a danger of getting sucked into too many interesting things and getting distracted from what you really want to do.)</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>在做出此决定时，您应该想去承担正确的风险。 大多数人对风险的看法是错误的——例如，留在大学似乎是一条没有风险的道路。 然而，在你最富有成效的四年里什么也没做实际上是相当冒险的。 创办一家你爱的公司是一种正确的风险。 但是在一家仍有很大可能会失败的公司成为第 50 号员工反而是错误的风险。</p>

<p>In making this decision, you want to take the right kind of risk.  Most people think about risk the wrong way—for example, staying in college seems like a non-risky path.  However, getting nothing done for four of your most productive years is actually pretty risky.  Starting a company that you’re in love with is the right kind of risk.  Becoming employee number 50 at a company that still has a good chance of failure is the wrong kind of risk.</p>

<p>如果你选择读大学，你要确保你学到一些有价值的东西并从事有趣的项目——大学可能是结识未来一起共事的人最佳场所。 如果你真的担心因为辍学会错过一些重要的社交体验，那么你应该留在大学里。</p>

<p>If you stay in college, make sure you learn something worthwhile and work on interesting projects—college is probably the best place to meet people to work with.  If you’re really worried you’ll miss some critical social experience by dropping out of college, you should probably stay.</p>

<p>如果你加入一家公司，我的一般建议是加入一家处于突破轨道上的公司。 在任意一个时期，你通常可以找到几个，而且对于聪明的年轻人来说，它们通常是可以识别的。 它们是一个非常好的风险/回报权衡。 这样的公司几乎肯定会成功，但世界其他地方并没有像他们应该的那样相信它。 幸运的是，这些公司喜欢有抱负的年轻人。 除了股权很重要（如果您加入一家小型新创业公司，您可能会获得 1/10 的股权，但风险是 1/100 或 1/1000），您将与非常 好人，了解成功的样子，并在你的记录中获得 W（事实证明这是非常有价值的）。 在一家失败的公司工作几年会产生路径后果，而在一家已经非常成功的公司工作意味着你学到的东西会少得多，而且可能与不那么令人印象深刻的人一起工作。</p>

<p>If you join a company, my general advice is to join a company on a breakout trajectory.  There are a usually a handful of these at a time, and they are usually identifiable to a smart young person.  They are a very good risk/reward tradeoff.  Such a company is almost certainly going to be successful, but the rest of the world isn’t quite as convinced of it as they should be.  Fortunately, these companies love ambitious young people.  In addition to the equity being a great deal (you might get 1/10th of the equity you’d get if you join a tiny new startup, but at 1/100th or 1/1000th of the risk), you will work with very good people, learn what success looks like, and get a W on your record (which turns out to be quite valuable).  Spending a few years at a company that fails has path consequences, and working at an already-massively-successful company means you will learn much less, and probably work with less impressive people.</p>
