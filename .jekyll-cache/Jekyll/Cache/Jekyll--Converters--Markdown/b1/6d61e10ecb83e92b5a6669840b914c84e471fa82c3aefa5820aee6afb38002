<p>为了庆祝 Airbnb 的IPO并写一些内容帮助未来的创始人，我认为解释一下 Airbnb 的特别之处可能会很有用。</p>

<p>To celebrate Airbnb’s IPO and to help future founders, I thought it might be useful to explain what was special about Airbnb.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>Airbnb 的特别之处在于他们非常热切。 他们不会事情只做一半，我们甚至在采访中也能感觉到这一点。有时，在我们面试了一家初创公司后，我们不确定该做什么，以至于后来我们要会后在商量一番。 而其他时候我们只是看着彼此微笑不知道说什么。我们面试Airbnbs就是这样。 我们甚至不太喜欢Airbnb的商业模式。 在当时，他们用户也没有；也看不到增长点。但创始人似乎精力充沛，让你不可能不喜欢他们。</p>

<p>What was special about the Airbnbs was how earnest they were. They did nothing half-way, and we could sense this even in the interview. Sometimes after we interviewed a startup we’d be uncertain what to do, and have to talk it over. Other times we’d just look at one another and smile. The Airbnbs’ interview was that kind. We didn’t even like the idea that much. Nor did users, at that stage; they had no growth. But the founders seemed so full of energy that it was impossible not to like them.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>我们的第一印象并没有错。 那一批我们孵化的企业里，我们给布莱恩·切斯基的昵称是塔斯马尼亚恶魔，因为就像卡通人物一样，他似乎是一股充满能量的龙卷风。他们三个创始人都是这样的。在 YC 期间，没有人比 Airbnb 更努力地工作。 当你与 Airbnb 交谈时，他们会记笔记。 如果你在办公时间向他们提出一个想法，下次你与他们交谈时，他们不仅会将这个想法实施，而且还会实施他们在此过程中提出的两个新想法。 “在我们资助的所有初创公司中，他们的态度可能是最好的”，我在那段时间写信给Mike Arrington如是说。</p>

<p>That first impression was not misleading. During the batch our nickname for Brian Chesky was The Tasmanian Devil, because like the cartoon character he seemed a tornado of energy. All three of them were like that. No one ever worked harder during YC than the Airbnbs did. When you talked to the Airbnbs, they took notes. If you suggested an idea to them in office hours, the next time you talked to them they’d not only have implemented it, but also implemented two new ideas they had in the process. “They probably have the best attitude of any startup we’ve funded” I wrote to Mike Arrington during the batch.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>他们现在还是那样。 杰西卡和我在 2018 年夏天和布莱恩共进晚餐，只有我们三个人。 至此，公司成立十年了。 那天晚上，他记录了一页关于 Airbnb 可以做的新事物的想法的笔记。</p>

<p>They’re still like that. Jessica and I had dinner with Brian in the summer of 2018, just the three of us. By this point the company is ten years old. He took a page of notes about ideas for new things Airbnb could do.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>当我们第一次见到布莱恩、乔和内森时，我们没有意识到 Airbnb 已经快要失败了。 他们在这个项目上工作了一年，没有增长，他们同意做最后一次尝试。 他们会尝试这个 Y Combinator 的东西，如果公司仍然没有起飞，他们就会放弃。</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>What we didn’t realize when we first met Brian and Joe and Nate was that Airbnb was on its last legs. After working on the company for a year and getting no growth, they’d agreed to give it one last shot. They’d try this Y Combinator thing, and if the company still didn’t take off, they’d give up.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>任何正常人早就放弃了。 他们一直用信用卡为公司提供资金。 他们有一个装满信用卡的活页夹。 投资者在当时对这个公司并不感冒。 他们在一家咖啡馆遇到的一位投资者在与他们会面的中途溜走了。 他们以为他要去洗手间，但他再也没有回来。 “他甚至没有喝完他的冰沙，”布赖恩说。 而现在，在 2008 年末，这是几十年来最严重的衰退。 股市处于自由落体状态，再过四个月都不会触底。</p>

<p>Any normal person would have given up already. They’d been funding the company with credit cards. They had a binder full of credit cards they’d maxed out. Investors didn’t think much of the idea. One investor they met in a cafe walked out in the middle of meeting with them. They thought he was going to the bathroom, but he never came back. “He didn’t even finish his smoothie,” Brian said. And now, in late 2008, it was the worst recession in decades. The stock market was in free fall and wouldn’t hit bottom for another four months.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>他们为什么不放弃？ 这是一个值得问的问题。 人和物体一样，在极端条件下会显露其本性。 有一点很清楚，他们这样做并不是为了钱。 作为一个赚钱的计划，这是非常糟糕的：一年的工作，他们所能展示的只是一个装满信用卡的活页夹。 那么为什么他们还在这家初创公司工作呢？ 因为他们作为第一批房东的经验。</p>

<p>Why hadn’t they given up? This is a useful question to ask. People, like matter, reveal their nature under extreme conditions. One thing that’s clear is that they weren’t doing this just for the money. As a money-making scheme, this was pretty lousy: a year’s work and all they had to show for it was a binder full of maxed-out credit cards. So why were they still working on this startup? Because of the experience they’d had as the first hosts.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>当他们第一次尝试在设计会议期间出租地板上的气垫床时，他们所希望的只是赚到足够的钱来支付当月的租金。 但令人惊讶的事情发生了：他们很喜欢让这三位客人和他们住在一起。 客人也很享受。 他们和客人住在了一起，因为他们在某种意义上是被迫的，但他们都有很棒的经历。 显然这里有一些新的东西：对于房东来说，一种新的赚钱方式实际上就出现在他们的眼皮底下；对于客人来说，一种在很多方面都比酒店更好的新的旅行方式出现了。</p>

<p>When they first tried renting out airbeds on their floor during a design convention, all they were hoping for was to make enough money to pay their rent that month. But something surprising happened: they enjoyed having those first three guests staying with them. And the guests enjoyed it too. Both they and the guests had done it because they were in a sense forced to, and yet they’d all had a great experience. Clearly there was something new here: for hosts, a new way to make money that had literally been right under their noses, and for guests, a new way to travel that was in many ways better than hotels.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>那次经历是Airbnbs没有放弃的原因。 他们知道他们发现了一些东西。 他们已经看到了未来的一瞥，他们不能放手。</p>

<p>That experience was why the Airbnbs didn’t give up. They knew they’d discovered something. They’d seen a glimpse of the future, and they couldn’t let it go.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>他们知道，一旦人们尝试住在现在称为“airbnb”的地方，他们也会意识到这就是未来。 但前提是他们尝试过，但他们没有。 这就是他们在 Y Combinator 期间的问题：开始增长。</p>

<p>They knew that once people tried staying in what is now called “an airbnb,” they would also realize that this was the future. But only if they tried it, and they weren’t. That was the problem during Y Combinator: to get growth started.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>Airbnb 在 YC 期间的目标是达到我们所说的拉面盈利能力，这意味着如果创始人靠拉面为生，公司可以赚到足够的钱来支付创始人的生活费。 拉面盈利显然不是任何初创公司的最终目标，但它是最重要的门槛，因为这是你腾飞的起点。 这是你不再需要投资者许可才能继续存在的转折点。 对于 Airbnb 来说，拉面盈利能力的基准是每月 4000 美元：租金 3500 美元，食物 500 美元。 他们将这个目标贴在公寓浴室的镜子上。</p>

<p>Airbnb’s goal during YC was to reach what we call ramen profitability, which means making enough money that the company can pay the founders’ living expenses, if they live on ramen noodles. Ramen profitability is not, obviously, the end goal of any startup, but it’s the most important threshold on the way, because this is the point where you’re airborne. This is the point where you no longer need investors’ permission to continue existing. For the Airbnbs, ramen profitability was $4000 a month: $3500 for rent, and $500 for food. They taped this goal to the mirror in the bathroom of their apartment.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>像 Airbnb 这样的公司开始增长的方法是专注于最热门的市场细分领域。 如果你能从那里开始增长，它就会蔓延到其他地方。 当我问Airbnbs哪里需求最大时，他们从搜索中得知：纽约市。 所以他们专注于纽约。 他们亲自去那里拜访他们的房东并帮助他们使他们的房源更具吸引力。 其中很大一部分是通过更好的图片。 于是乔和布赖恩租了一台专业相机，自己拍了房东家的照片。</p>

<p>The way to get growth started in something like Airbnb is to focus on the hottest subset of the market. If you can get growth started there, it will spread to the rest. When I asked the Airbnbs where there was most demand, they knew from searches: New York City. So they focused on New York. They went there in person to visit their hosts and help them make their listings more attractive. A big part of that was better pictures. So Joe and Brian rented a professional camera and took pictures of the hosts’ places themselves.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>这样的做法这不仅使房源呈现显得更好。 也让他们了解到了他们的房东。 当他们第一次从纽约旅行回来时，我问他们注意到哪些关于房东的事情让他们感到惊讶的地方，他们说最大的惊讶是有多少房东和他们有相同的处境：他们需要这笔钱用来支付他们的房租。 请记住，这是几十年来最严重的衰退，它首先袭击了纽约。 这无疑增加了 Airbnb 的使命感，即人们需要他们。</p>

<p>This didn’t just make the listings better. It also taught them about their hosts. When they came back from their first trip to New York, I asked what they’d noticed about hosts that surprised them, and they said the biggest surprise was how many of the hosts were in the same position they’d been in: they needed this money to pay their rent. This was, remember, the worst recession in decades, and it had hit New York first. It definitely added to the Airbnbs’ sense of mission to feel that people needed them.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>2009 年 1 月下旬，在加入Y Combinator 大约三周后，他们的努力开始显现成果，他们的人数逐渐上升。 但很难确定是增长还是随机波动。 到 2 月，很明显这是真正的增长。 他们在 2 月的第一周赚了 460 美元，第二周赚了 897 美元，第三周赚了 1428 美元。 就是这样：他们的生意开始起飞了。 布赖恩在 2 月 22 日给我发了一封电子邮件，宣布他们拉面盈利，并提供了过去三周的数据。</p>

<p>In late January 2009, about three weeks into Y Combinator, their efforts started to show results, and their numbers crept upward. But it was hard to say for sure whether it was growth or just random fluctuation. By February it was clear that it was real growth. They made $460 in fees in the first week of February, $897 in the second, and $1428 in the third. That was it: they were airborne. Brian sent me an email on February 22 announcing that they were ramen profitable and giving the last three weeks’ numbers.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>“我想你应该知道你现在需要为下周准备做什么了，”我回答道。</p>

<p>“I assume you know what you’ve now set yourself up for next week,” I responded.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>布赖恩的回答是七个字：“我们不会放慢速度。”</p>

<p>Brian’s reply was seven words: “We are not going to slow down.”</p>
