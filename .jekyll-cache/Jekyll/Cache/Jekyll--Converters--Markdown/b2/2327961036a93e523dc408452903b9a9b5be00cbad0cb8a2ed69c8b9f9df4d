<p>(This is a talk I gave at the last Y Combinator dinner of the summer. Usually we donâ€™t have a speaker at the last dinner; itâ€™s more of a party. But it seemed worth spoiling the atmosphere if I could save some of the startups from preventable deaths. So at the last minute I cooked up this rather grim talk. I didnâ€™t mean this as an essay; I wrote it down because I only had two hours before dinner and think fastest while writing.)</p>

<p>A couple days ago I told a reporter that we expected about a third of the companies we funded to succeed. Actually I was being conservative. Iâ€™m hoping it might be as much as a half. Wouldnâ€™t it be amazing if we could achieve a 50% success rate?</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>Another way of saying that is that half of you are going to die. Phrased that way, it doesnâ€™t sound good at all. In fact, itâ€™s kind of weird when you think about it, because our definition of success is that the founders get rich. If half the startups we fund succeed, then half of you are going to get rich and the other half are going to get nothing.</p>

<p>If you can just avoid dying, you get rich. That sounds like a joke, but itâ€™s actually a pretty good description of what happens in a typical startup. It certainly describes what happened in Viaweb. We avoided dying till we got rich.</p>

<p>It was really close, too. When we were visiting Yahoo to talk about being acquired, we had to interrupt everything and borrow one of their conference rooms to talk down an investor who was about to back out of a new funding round we needed to stay alive. So even in the middle of getting rich we were fighting off the grim reaper.</p>

<p>You may have heard that quote about luck consisting of opportunity meeting preparation. Youâ€™ve now done the preparation. The work youâ€™ve done so far has, in effect, put you in a position to get lucky: you can now get rich by not letting your company die. Thatâ€™s more than most people have. So letâ€™s talk about how not to die.</p>

<p>Weâ€™ve done this five times now, and weâ€™ve seen a bunch of startups die. About 10 of them so far. We donâ€™t know exactly what happens when they die, because they generally donâ€™t die loudly and heroically. Mostly they crawl off somewhere and die.</p>

<p>For us the main indication of impending doom is when we donâ€™t hear from you. When we havenâ€™t heard from, or about, a startup for a couple months, thatâ€™s a bad sign. If we send them an email asking whatâ€™s up, and they donâ€™t reply, thatâ€™s a really bad sign. So far that is a 100% accurate predictor of death.</p>

<p>That may not be so naive as it sounds. Youâ€™ve probably noticed that having dinners every Tuesday with us and the other founders causes you to get more done than you would otherwise, because every dinner is a mini Demo Day. Every dinner is a kind of a deadline. So the mere constraint of staying in regular contact with us will push you to make things happen, because otherwise youâ€™ll be embarrassed to tell us that you havenâ€™t done anything new since the last time we talked.</p>

<p>A variant is to stay in touch with other YC-funded startups. There is now a whole neighborhood of them in San Francisco. If you move there, the peer pressure that made you work harder all summer will continue to operate.</p>

<p>When startups die, the official cause of death is always either running out of money or a critical founder bailing. Often the two occur simultaneously. But I think the underlying cause is usually that theyâ€™ve become demoralized. You rarely hear of a startup thatâ€™s working around the clock doing deals and pumping out new features, and dies because they canâ€™t pay their bills and their ISP unplugs their server.</p>

<p>If so many startups get demoralized and fail when merely by hanging on they could get rich, you have to assume that running a startup can be demoralizing. That is certainly true. Iâ€™ve been there, and thatâ€™s why Iâ€™ve never done another startup. The low points in a startup are just unbelievably low. I bet even Google had moments where things seemed hopeless.</p>

<p>Knowing that should help. If you know itâ€™s going to feel terrible sometimes, then when it feels terrible you wonâ€™t think â€œouch, this feels terrible, I give up.â€ It feels that way for everyone. And if you just hang on, things will probably get better. The metaphor people use to describe the way a startup feels is at least a roller coaster and not drowning. You donâ€™t just sink and sink; there are ups after the downs.</p>

<p>Another feeling that seems alarming but is in fact normal in a startup is the feeling that what youâ€™re doing isnâ€™t working. The reason you can expect to feel this is that what you do probably wonâ€™t work. Startups almost never get it right the first time. Much more commonly you launch something, and no one cares. Donâ€™t assume when this happens that youâ€™ve failed. Thatâ€™s normal for startups. But donâ€™t sit around doing nothing. Iterate.</p>

<p>I like Paul Buchheitâ€™s suggestion of trying to make something that at least someone really loves. As long as youâ€™ve made something that a few users are ecstatic about, youâ€™re on the right track. It will be good for your morale to have even a handful of users who really love you, and startups run on morale. But also it will tell you what to focus on. What is it about you that they love? Can you do more of that? Where can you find more people who love that sort of thing? As long as you have some core of users who love you, all you have to do is expand it. It may take a while, but as long as you keep plugging away, youâ€™ll win in the end. Both Blogger and Delicious did that. Both took years to succeed. But both began with a core of fanatically devoted users, and all Evan and Joshua had to do was grow that core incrementally. Wufoo is on the same trajectory now.</p>

<p>So when you release something and it seems like no one cares, look more closely. Are there zero users who really love you, or is there at least some little group that does? Itâ€™s quite possible there will be zero. In that case, tweak your product and try again. Every one of you is working on a space that contains at least one winning permutation somewhere in it. If you just keep trying, youâ€™ll find it.</p>

<p>Let me mention some things not to do. The number one thing not to do is other things. If you find yourself saying a sentence that ends with â€œbut weâ€™re going to keep working on the startup,â€ you are in big trouble. Bobâ€™s going to grad school, but weâ€™re going to keep working on the startup. Weâ€™re moving back to Minnesota, but weâ€™re going to keep working on the startup. Weâ€™re taking on some consulting projects, but weâ€™re going to keep working on the startup. You may as well just translate these to â€œweâ€™re giving up on the startup, but weâ€™re not willing to admit that to ourselves,â€ because thatâ€™s what it means most of the time. A startup is so hard that working on it canâ€™t be preceded by â€œbut.â€</p>

<p>In particular, donâ€™t go to graduate school, and donâ€™t start other projects. Distraction is fatal to startups. Going to (or back to) school is a huge predictor of death because in addition to the distraction it gives you something to say youâ€™re doing. If youâ€™re only doing a startup, then if the startup fails, you fail. If youâ€™re in grad school and your startup fails, you can say later â€œOh yeah, we had this startup on the side when I was in grad school, but it didnâ€™t go anywhere.â€</p>

<p>You canâ€™t use euphemisms like â€œdidnâ€™t go anywhereâ€ for something thatâ€™s your only occupation. People wonâ€™t let you.</p>
