<p>(This is a talk I gave at the last Y Combinator dinner of the summer. Usually we donâ€™t have a speaker at the last dinner; itâ€™s more of a party. But it seemed worth spoiling the atmosphere if I could save some of the startups from preventable deaths. So at the last minute I cooked up this rather grim talk. I didnâ€™t mean this as an essay; I wrote it down because I only had two hours before dinner and think fastest while writing.)</p>

<p>A couple days ago I told a reporter that we expected about a third of the companies we funded to succeed. Actually I was being conservative. Iâ€™m hoping it might be as much as a half. Wouldnâ€™t it be amazing if we could achieve a 50% success rate?</p>
