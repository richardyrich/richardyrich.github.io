<p class="large-block-text">Interviewer question: To set the stage here. I think Billâ€¦ itâ€™s 1991 when you and I first met. To put this in context, you were mid-twenties and Iâ€™ve just gotten started as a rookie professor two years before. Bill at the time was trying to set up an interesting business which ultimately became Gotham Partners. For those of you who are students, as a 20-something-year-old, Bill set up his first hedge fund. Why did you set up Gotham, Bill? What did you learn from that experience?</p>

<p class="large-block-text">Bill Ackman: Emmâ€¦ Experience is making mistakes and learning from them. Thatâ€™s what I have learned. So the answer is, I went to business school to learn how to be a good investor. I learned the first rule of investing, which is you do your due diligence before you wire your money. When I got to HBS, I actually opened the course catalog for the first time, there wasnâ€™t a class on investing not a class on accounting, not a class on finance. So I decided I had to develop my own little self-study program.</p>

<p class="large-block-text"> So I wanted toâ€¦ So I opened a fidelity brokerage account. I said this: â€œI had some money Iâ€™ve made in the real estate brokerage business. This was my tuition in the investment business.â€ It was about a year of tuition. If I lost it, it was as if I had gone to business school for two years but paid for three. I figure it is being the inverse of the Oxford 1+1 program. And you know, the first stock I bought went up and I said: â€œOkey, I found what I want to do.â€ A little bit more involved than that.</p>

<p class="large-block-text">But Iâ€¦actually my fatherâ€”whoâ€™s here, he came with us, thatâ€™s dad over there in the cornerâ€”you can ask him whatever questions you want afterwards. He told me it is a really dumb idea to start an investment fund right out of the business school. And he recommended that I go work for Michael Steinhardt or George Soros or one of the other famous investors at the time. But I figured that I know enough. This is the perils of youth. But the answer is, I was an entrepreneur. And I felt that I wanted to approach investing my own way as opposed to learning from someone else.</p>

<p class="large-block-text">Itâ€™s one of the few things you can really learn on your own. You can learn investing by reading books, by reading annual reports, by having aâ€¦you can have a portfolio and invest $100 and you can learn the business, unlike many other businesses, which require a lot more. At least that is what I thought at the time.</p>
