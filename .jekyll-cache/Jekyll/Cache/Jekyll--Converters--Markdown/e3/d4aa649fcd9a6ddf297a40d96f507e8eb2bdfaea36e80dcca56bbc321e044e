I"V<p>（这是我在夏天最后一次 Y Combinator 晚宴上发表的演讲。通常我们在最后一次晚宴上没有演讲者；这更像是一个聚会。这样的内容听起来很扫兴，但是如果我能帮助一些创业公司从避免一些可预防的死亡也是值得了。所以在最后一刻我准备了这个相当冷酷的谈话。我当时没有想把这写成一篇文章；我把它写下来是因为我在晚餐前只有两个小时，而且在写作时思考得最快。）</p>

<p>(This is a talk I gave at the last Y Combinator dinner of the summer. Usually we don’t have a speaker at the last dinner; it’s more of a party. But it seemed worth spoiling the atmosphere if I could save some of the startups from preventable deaths. So at the last minute I cooked up this rather grim talk. I didn’t mean this as an essay; I wrote it down because I only had two hours before dinner and think fastest while writing.)</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>几天前，我告诉记者，我们预计我们投资的公司中约有三分之一会取得成功。 其实我是说的这个数字保守估计的。 我猜测可能实际上可能有一半。 如果我们能达到 50% 的成功率，那不是很神奇吗？</p>

<p>A couple days ago I told a reporter that we expected about a third of the companies we funded to succeed. Actually I was being conservative. I’m hoping it might be as much as a half. Wouldn’t it be amazing if we could achieve a 50% success rate?</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>另一种说法是你们中的一半人将死去。 这么一说，一点都不好听。 事实上，想想这有点奇怪，因为我们对成功的定义是创始人能够致富。 如果我们资助的一半创业公司成功了，那么你们中的一半会变得富有，而另一半将一无所获。</p>

<p>Another way of saying that is that half of you are going to die. Phrased that way, it doesn’t sound good at all. In fact, it’s kind of weird when you think about it, because our definition of success is that the founders get rich. If half the startups we fund succeed, then half of you are going to get rich and the other half are going to get nothing.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>如果你能避免死亡，你就会变得富有。 这听起来像是一个笑话，但它实际上很好地描述了典型创业公司中发生的事情。 它当然描述了在我在Viaweb 中发生的事情。 我们避免死亡，直到我们变得富有。</p>

<p>If you can just avoid dying, you get rich. That sounds like a joke, but it’s actually a pretty good description of what happens in a typical startup. It certainly describes what happened in Viaweb. We avoided dying till we got rich.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>死亡当时距离我们非常接近。 当我们访问雅虎谈论被收购时，我们不得不打断一切并借用他们的一个会议室来说服一位即将退出的新一轮融资的投资者，而他的资金对我们存活下来至关重要。 因此，即使在致富的过程中，我们也在与死神搏斗。</p>

<p>It was really close, too. When we were visiting Yahoo to talk about being acquired, we had to interrupt everything and borrow one of their conference rooms to talk down an investor who was about to back out of a new funding round we needed to stay alive. So even in the middle of getting rich we were fighting off the grim reaper.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>你可能听过运气就是机会加上准备。 你现在已经完成了准备工作。 到目前为止，你所做的工作实际上使你处于幸运的位置：你现在可以通过不让公司死亡来致富。 这已经比大多数人都好太多了。 那么让我们来谈谈如何不死。</p>

<p>You may have heard that quote about luck consisting of opportunity meeting preparation. You’ve now done the preparation. The work you’ve done so far has, in effect, put you in a position to get lucky: you can now get rich by not letting your company die. That’s more than most people have. So let’s talk about how not to die.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>我们现在已经这样做了五次，我们已经看到一堆初创公司死掉了。 到目前为止大约有10个。 我们不知道他们死后会发生什么，因为他们通常不会大喊而英勇地死去。 大多数情况下，它们会爬到某个我们不知道的角落然后悄然消逝。</p>

<p>We’ve done this five times now, and we’ve seen a bunch of startups die. About 10 of them so far. We don’t know exactly what happens when they die, because they generally don’t die loudly and heroically. Mostly they crawl off somewhere and die.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>对我们来说，即将到来的厄运的主要迹象是当我们没有收到你的消息时。 当我们几个月没有听到或关于这家初创公司的消息时，这是一个不好的迹象。 如果我们向他们发送电子邮件询问发生了什么事，而他们没有回复，那是一个非常糟糕的信号。 到目前为止，这是一个 100% 准确的死亡预测指标。</p>

<p>For us the main indication of impending doom is when we don’t hear from you. When we haven’t heard from, or about, a startup for a couple months, that’s a bad sign. If we send them an email asking what’s up, and they don’t reply, that’s a really bad sign. So far that is a 100% accurate predictor of death.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>然而，如果一家初创公司定期进行新的签单和发布新产品，或者向我们发送邮件或出现在 YC 活动中，它可能会继续存在。</p>

<p>Whereas if a startup regularly does new deals and releases and either sends us mail or shows up at YC events, they’re probably going to live.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>我意识到这听起来很幼稚，但也许这种联系是双向的。 也许如果你能让我们不断收到你的消息，你就不会死。</p>

<p>I realize this will sound naive, but maybe the linkage works in both directions. Maybe if you can arrange that we keep hearing from you, you won’t die.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>这可能不像听起来那么天真。 你可能已经注意到，每周二与我们和其他创始人共进晚餐会使你完成的工作比平时多，因为每顿晚餐都是一个迷你演示日。 每顿晚餐都是一种最后期限。 因此，仅与我们保持定期联系的要求就会促你您完成任务，因为否则你会尴尬地告诉我们自上次我们交谈以来你没有做任何新的事情。</p>

<p>That may not be so naive as it sounds. You’ve probably noticed that having dinners every Tuesday with us and the other founders causes you to get more done than you would otherwise, because every dinner is a mini Demo Day. Every dinner is a kind of a deadline. So the mere constraint of staying in regular contact with us will push you to make things happen, because otherwise you’ll be embarrassed to tell us that you haven’t done anything new since the last time we talked.</p>
