<p>你应该从事那些你非常热爱的事情。<strong>别追随所谓的当下最热门的事情。</strong>我相信大家都见过这种情况。我认为大家各行各业都看到这样的情况，但是在互联网行业这种情况相当的多多。现在是一个互联网创业潮时期。比如说，1999年的时候，人们对互联网趋之若鹜，他们争相辞职然后说：“我打算做一点关于互联网的事情”。这有点像是1849年那段时间的加利福尼亚淘金热。</p>

<p>Do something you’re very passionate about. And don’t try to chase what is kind of the hot passion of the day. I think we actually saw this. I think you see it all over the place in many different contexts but I think we saw it in the internet world quite a bit where it’s sort of peak of Internet mania. Say 1999 you found people who were very passionate, they left their job and decided “I’m gonna do something in the internet.” It was almost like the 1849 Gold Rush in a way.</p>

<p><br />

<p>如果你读过关于那段事情的历史，你会发现这么一些人。那段时间所有人都跑到加利福尼亚附近，他们当中的有些人可能是医生，但是为了淘金他们放弃了医生这一职业。（贝佐斯大笑）这样的做法几乎很难成功。即便从金钱的角度上他们可能或的了某种成功，但是我怀疑这并不会给他们带来持久的快乐。所以你必须清楚了解自己。</p>

<p>You find those people if you go back and study the history of the 1849 Gold Rush. You will find that at that time everybody who was in within the shouting distance of California. They might have been a doctor but they quit being a doctor and they started panning for gold. That almost never works. And even if it does work you know according to some metric financial success or whatever might be. I suspect it leaves you ultimately unsatisfied so you really need to be very clear with yourself.</p>

<p><br />
<br /></p>

<p><strong>我认为了解自己的最好的办法之一就是想象自己已经到了80岁，然后倒过来规划人生。</strong>尝试着最小化你可能会出现的后悔的次数。这样的做法适用于职业选择，适用于家庭的选择。我有一个14个月大的儿子。我觉得一个对我而言显而易见的决定就是，我希望我在80岁的时候发现我在他成长的过程中一直都能够陪伴他。我不想等到80岁的时候，突然意识到：“糟糕！我错过了这整个时期。我没能和我儿子建立一段我想有的关系。”我的其他的决定也是如此。</p>

<p>And I think one of the best ways to do that is this notion of projecting yourself forward to age 80 looking back on your life and trying to make sure you’ve minimized the number of regrets you have. That works for that works for career decisions it works for family decisions. I have a 14-month-old son and it’s very easy for me if I think about myself when I’m 80 I know I want to watch that little guy grow up. I don’t want to be 80 and think: “shoot! I missed that whole thing and I don’t have the kind of relationship with my son that I wished I had.” And so on and so on.</p>

<p><br />
<br /></p>

<p><strong>另外一点，我推荐大家都从长计议。</strong>我明白有些人会反对这样的做法。很多人认为你应该及时行乐。不过我认为你考虑到相当长度的未来，你应该做那些长期来看会让你感到满意的事情。至少吧，这个方法对我来说挺有效的。幸福的方法有很多，每个人应该找到自己合适的那一种。</p>

<p>I guess another thing that I would recommend to people is that they should always take a long-term point of view. I think this is something about which there’s a lot of controversies. There’s a there is something a lot of people—and I’m not one of them—believe that you should live for the now. I think what you should do is you think about the the great expanse of time ahead of you and try to make sure that you’re planning for that in a way that’s going to leave you ultimately satisfied. So, this is just mine, this is the way that works for me. I mean this is everybody needs to find that for themselves. There are a lot of paths to satisfaction and you need to find one that works for you.</p>
