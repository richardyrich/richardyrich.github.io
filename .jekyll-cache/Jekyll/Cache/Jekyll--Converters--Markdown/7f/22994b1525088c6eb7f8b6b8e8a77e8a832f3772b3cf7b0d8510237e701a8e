I spent many years working with founders and now I work with researchers.</p>

<p>Although there are always individual exceptions, on average itâ€™s surprising to me how different the best people in these groups are (including in some qualities that I had assumed were present in great people everywhere, like very high levels of self-belief).</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>So Iâ€™ve been thinking about the ways theyâ€™re the same, because maybe there is something to learn about qualities of really effective people in general.</p>

<p>The best people in both groups spend a lot of time reflecting on some version of the Hamming questionâ€”â€what are the most important problems in your field, and why arenâ€™t you working on them?â€ In general, no one reflects on this question enough, but the best people do it the most, and have the best â€˜problem tasteâ€™, which is some combination of learning to think independently, reason about the future, and identify attack vectors. (This from John Schulman is worth reading: http://joschu.net/blog/opinionated-guide-ml-research.html).</p>

<p>They have a laser focus on the next step in front of them combined with long-term vision. Most people only have one or the other.</p>

<p>They are extremely persistent and willing to work hard. As far as I can tell, there is no high-probability way to be very successful without this, and you should be suspicious of people who tell you otherwise unless youâ€™d be happy having their career (and be especially suspicious if they worked hard themselves).</p>

<p>They have a bias towards action and trying things, and theyâ€™re clear-eyed and honest about what is working and what isnâ€™t (importantly, this goes both waysâ€”Iâ€™m amazed by how many people will see something working and then not pursue it).</p>

<p>They are creative idea-generatorsâ€”a lot of the ideas may be terrible, but there is never a shortage.</p>

<p>They really value autonomy and have a hard time with rules that they donâ€™t think make sense. They are definitely not lemmings.</p>

<p>Their motivations are often more complex than they seemâ€”specifically, they are frequently very driven by genuine curiosity.</p>
